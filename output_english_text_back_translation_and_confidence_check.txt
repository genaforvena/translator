The Darkness of Your Eyes

Cat's heart

The fifth angel buzzed,

And I saw a star,

Which fell down from the sky to the earth,

And she was given the key to the treasure of the abyss.

Opening 9.1

Sonia sits on a bench in front of the parade, folding her child's hands on her knees and staring right in front of her in the dark of the bushes. Not that she sees something invisible to an ordinary person, not that she's dreaming of something big and cold like a coal iceberg, Sona is a fantasy, because she doesn't believe in the coming of the future. On her right there is a dark rectangle of a sixteen-storey house, stained with yellow windows, a house in which her dark childhood, full of loneliness and tears, passed. Her childhood, uh, how terrible it is now from his bottom.

Sonya can't live. Sleep does not come to her any more to calm her cold heart, to put down the cleavages of the eyelids, to dissolve at least part of the time in the warm forgot the summer evenings of the quiet village apple garden. Sony's insomnia is a huge star vortex that starts out of her chest and turns her from being a human into a space element that doesn't need rest. Sony's path leads to the past, and her feet rarely touch the ground.

Sonja lifts his hands off his knees, brings them up to his face, and spreads his white hair, staring into the mirror of the autumn sky. Sonya's legs, covered from the middle of their thighs with only black stockings, are iced by a ruthless wind, which is tightly pressed together, probably for the purpose of even distribution of cold and entropy. The radio is playing through the open window, where the light has been cut off.

The wooden door of the front door, which says a piece of white brick with the quadrupled name CHETA+, does not seem to be suitable for opening, but is made simply for the appearance of an opportunity to come out or enter. Her punctured edges rose from under the paint with stings into the joint, the pen was destroyed long ago, and at the human face level, in a double Fanner, the wrong shape of the hole was punctured, apparently cats, birds, or other targeted animals scratched through a false place of their true path.

Sonia is slowly passing through the car, pouring lemon blood on her headlights, stopping at a nearby house and going out. No one comes out of her iced wind of the hull, the driver's head drops safely to the steering wheel. Sonia rises from her seat and moves along the bushes in a line close to the Euclidian line, asphalt is unpleasantly punctured through the stocking tissue of her feet, without a shoe, so Sonja regrets the rain.

Her calves shone above the evening sidewalk, lit by the bizarre faces of the chandelier, she passes through the second window, stops and looks into an empty lit window, as if she saw a monstrous fly on someone's clean plaster wall. At a real angle of about 30 degrees to the wall of the house there is a grey cat, one whose color is specially chosen for the living of stoneyards and rusty carnivals, the hunting of mice in basement labyrinths, and the expositional harmony with dense summer sunsets of spacious roofs.

From where Sonja is now standing, you can see a tree growing on the other side of the house, a semi-flying chestnut that remembers a time when there was no concrete horror around it, and there was a stormy hill and a few rural houses that were barely visible behind the cluttering of the branches of the growing cherry. In the chestnut there are two dupples, one near the root, in which Sonny's childhood boys incited fire and blew up pistons, the second by a meter above human growth, where Sonya once hid a doll found by her in a sandbox, masked her blue eyes with a leaf, but the light of those eyes entered through the leaves and an unknown thief lured Sonino's treasure into the dark depths of other people's entrances, where old books and roasted meat smelled, and where strange people did not live with Sonja's life together.

Sonia pulls out a small scalp and slowly brushes his white hair without rushing. From the corner of the house, there's a young couple, a girl driving a wheelchair in front of her, a thick sorority with a red light on her evening walk. The wind licks the thin hairlines out of his hair, the eye can't see, the man is strict and self-restraint. They roll into a street full of noisy poplars, whose trunks carry the wind up tops of colourless creatures so different from humans. Sonia slowly brushes her white hair, and the wind makes her work endlessly, spinning them again. There's a connection between Sonia and the wind, probably because they're both aliens from another time.

At the end of his fruitless work, Sonja puts the crest back into his pocket and continues to move along the line of bushes, reaches the corner of the house, and sees another house, dark and unconstructed, from which a crane sticks, like the shadow of something terrible, and on which people walk in construction helmets and the searchlights move. Before the entrance of the house, concrete beams are sticking out of the ground, like columns of an antique temple, and the mud - clogged moss dump lights the unindicated wall in front of it. Sonja thinks first of the strange eyes of machines that drain the light instead of picking it up, then the souls of unborn people living in shrapneled bricks and building garbage, and finally of the burned concrete dust and alcohol purging of Satan's builders, men in yellow helmets, and women in flowery costons who, without knowing any architectural plan and the necessary number of bricks, build huge buildings of human memory from space matter of dreams at night. Like vampires, they slowly move on the arrows of the cranes, screaming something in the unexplained mother tongue of the dead, their construction has no end and grows like a Babylonian malign tower, struggling to reach the cold silk of the clouds.

By ankles falling into raw mud, Sonya enters a huge rusty gate and ends up in a sandy area, ripped by wheels of dumps, at the foot of concrete poles covered with rusty bars, where the magic of the dead binds the concrete. On the edge of the square, a pile of oil - impregnated glass will burn on the sandstone, reminiscent of the blacked body of the rhinoceros. Sonia covers the shadow of a crane-trapped white plate stacking air, and it's squeezing its head, which there are forces screaming upstairs. Her voice, like this, fits into the scrap of crane chains and metal ropes on the edge of concrete plates, searchlights, tensioned by wind rabies. It flies into the square eyes of unglazed windows, and the builders of their deaths see the ghost of a seagull, with its wind in the depths of a rock rising from the earth, the great depths of the stars sky above their heads. Lavina screams back, faces are distorted by pain that cannot be measured alive, pieces of brick and sharp craftsmen poisoned by a construction solution fly from above to Sonya, and sand explosions surround her. Sonia removes her hair from her head, and a quarter of the brick that is broken by the hands of the fourteenth Christ, Christ the builder and the coal man. Sonia falls back with its hands spread, and galaxy rivers accelerate their currents, washing its face with ice water, transparent fish filled with suspended pieces of light kissing it in a holocaust, and all forty-eight winds, of which people only know four, open up to it, and she sees the answer to her question.

She sees a geometric field covered with black marble, huge as an empty airfield, and in the middle of its quadrupled pyramid of black glass, in which steps are cut out, and twelve beautiful comsomolcs standing in symmetrically correct places, with torches braided with cosmos and Komsomol badges on black dresses to the knees, and a forest of mirrored anthracy trees, falling between the trunks of snow, sleeping the hair of countless rows of pioneers giving out eternal saluts, and three black lakes, from whose surface a tomb fog rises, and a black tower between them reflected in the mirror glacial, concentrated in the extraterrestrial fluid of solar fire, and the sun itself, hanging in the middle of the black stars sky, burning the flames across the edges, but not giving light to the earth.

She hears the thunder of underground trains in impermeable darkness, covered with soil from the eye, where the creeping passage of plants that process lime into salt, stone into bread, wood into human flesh vibrates. It guesses the area hidden in the solids, full of cherry gardens, white domes, and blooming fields that are inaccessible to the organs of vision, because the light immediately goes out in the mysterious cool space of their existence, it guesses the trace of who it is looking for, the side view of his snorkeled eyes, and it is once again covered by the incorruptible desire to see his face.

The builders bury Sonya on the left side of the building if they become the back of the main entrance, under the bottom of the pit, open for the next concrete swai for the foundation of the future annex. Sonya's virgin corpse is supposed to strengthen the building and consecrate the chosen place, in accordance with the ancient custom of builders and coal diggers, for whose crimes the uninvited used to accuse Jews. One of the slaves wants to disfigure the girl's face with a handyman, for the sake of greater conspiracy, but considering that it is unlikely that anyone will find a face before it rots, they bury it like this, and one of the builders who also have children, even snatches Sona the old torn building rope used to scare the crow away from the boilers with boiled resin, and turns Sonya's head toward the sunrise, not for religious reasons, but so that the sand in the nose is attacked, although no one's blood will be snorkeled, and the craneman whose faces weren't removed by the hat simply spit in Sonya, aiming at the face, but not getting into the face and swearing, because the girl is already buried.

Work at the construction site stops around 2:00 a.m., about half an hour after that, construction workers fire wire-coated live cats and drink yellowish murky liquid from a three-litre can, pouring it into metal circles, telling stories, smoking, and eating sausage. Then they split up into cars, where they have very rough group sex, torturing their women, who are much smaller than men. At that time, outside the human perception, because he was either still asleep or already dead, Sonya was chosen from the sand pit and washes his face in a puddle formed on the roughness of a concrete piece. She removes the dirty stockings and wipes the hands and feet with them, soaking the stockings with water, and she washes the blood off her face and unwashs the hair that's stuck on the punctured temple. Sitting on concrete, she wipes the sand out of her hair and spits it out of her mouth.

When Sonia throws the broken stockings into a can of paint, she crawls her elbows into her knees, and the cheeks in her palms, and thinks of the growth of the present into the past and of God's mysterious desire, as expressed in the letter of her eternal book, in the letter of the E.I., which she imagines God in his tree form, which she thinks is particularly frightening and disturbing. Geometrically, God has no direction because he grows from nowhere to nowhere. Aggressing the ubiquitousness, which is based only on human understanding, Sonya has placed God in front of him and has given him the characteristics of a huge werewolf that commands the wind and the rain. God's mortality is beyond question, and in the future he has long since died, but in the past he created as a trap for living creatures, he will not be saved from it. Sonja understood how an unknown force drove to her unflagging wall of creation, where God himself and those who controlled it would rip her living body apart into bloody fat with hair.

A pile of glass mats at the construction site slowly fades out, and the wind carries a faint stinking smoke into the darkness of unending nightfields. Sonia jumps off the stove, barefoot approaches a burned cat curled up to the waist and warms the sunny feet in warm ash. Stars trembling from the wind like tree toys, and on the roof of the house lies a dry white rock moon.

With the spicy rusty gland, Sonja enters a dark wagon, within which large smellers sleep, then the people who spread their hands with thicker fingers from continuous work with concrete, see in the searchlight triangle an unshaved male face with a burrow open in his sleep, filling a light spot and appearing to be even bigger, lifts iron with both hands and beats a sleeping person in the eye with force. The man twitches the whole body, squeaks his legs on the bed, and moves his head, twists his neck, his mouth squeals with its mouth, while Sonya turns his weapon around in his eye, and the ink blood that she throws out of his head is bubbling in the face of a man into the dark. When Sonja realizes that a man is already dead, she pulls a brain-spoiled iron out of her head and sits on the squat in front of a second man sleeping in a sitting position next to the wall, his pants are unbuttoned, and a thick sysyscope-like cock comes out of the fly. A man snores and groans in his sleep, he probably still dreams of the same schoolgirls playing in a half dark apartment with flowers and other objects of dead nature, when Sonya puts a rusty edge on his eye and breaths him inside. The man &apos; s torso is immediately pushed forward as if he were aiming for a woman &apos; s body, jumping up to his feet, throwing Sonya to the bed, and pulling out with the force of a crippled animal, like a large horny animal, neck from her arms, throwing itself at the opposite wall of the wagon, and hitting her on the side of the wagon, dislodging the door with his shoulder and falling into a short stairwell, pushed into the abyss of the earth.

Without caring any more about his fate, Sonja finds an axe on the table to cut the sausage and, using it instead of iron, kills a half-waken young woman with a beautiful and greedy face, trying blindly to protect the blistered hands of the dead, while Sonya beats her on the head and kills her from the second time. On top of the woman's body, Sonja bites the woman's neck and slowly sucks the blood of the stunt into the living corpse with her belly and breasts, and thus, sucks, sleeps, and drowns her face in a dream into huge liquid flowers filled with unearthed paint from the gardens of paradise.

And then darkly, she wakes up and leaves her iron dope, walking in place of the stairs right on the top of the stairwell, a corpse whose face is cheek-dropping into the mud. Everything's sleeping around with its immobility, and a hard time slowly sinking into its bottomless murky, and the moon, enjoying its loneliness, turned its terrible rear face to the ground. Sonia enters an unconstructed house and, after learning each step and every object abandoned by the builders, goes up to the top floor. It's dark inside the house, the light of the searchlights doesn't get in here, and Sonya's shoulder is touching sometimes with a pin and burning wool crawling on the walls of invisible animals. Somewhere in the approaching black height, water is pouring, these stars slip through the limits of God's power and slip away to eternity. The rooms on the last floor have no ceiling, and in the middle of one of them shines at the moon a large puddle in which Sonja washs and waters the blood - smelling mouth. The window shows naked trees covered in water with lanterns and rare cars in the backyards.

Sonia goes into the windowway and looks down, on a mountain of sand, and the excavator crept into the slope. As it moves forward, it flies several metres and falls both feet on a thick metal cable that holds the crane to the wall of the house. For a few seconds, she takes the balance, putting her hands aside and balancing on a vibrating cable, the poisonous tissue of the rusty support burns the bare feet. Finally, the cable and the body of Sonya stop all vertical movement and, by holding the soaking monodimensionality of space, Sonja easily rises up the rope to the stairs of the crane, climbing up to the cab and coming out to the wind - humming arrow. Sonia needs precision here, and standing on the tip of an arrow near a wheel wrapped up in engine oil with a crane cable, she's counting on the distance until she finally flies to the carnival of the ninth floor of a nearby house. It is not easy for her to fly, and she struggles with the wind for a long time on a cold tile wall, flowing through transparent night air, before she can jump onto an open balcony. Here, swinging in an old braided chair covered in a ripped blanket, Sonja waits for the next night to continue her journey.

An old man and an old woman live in an apartment that she has chosen for her nest, both demented and sick, only an old man can go outside, so he buys bread, kefir, and vermichelle from the store, from which the old woman then cooks a uniform meal. Old people's lives flow almost without sound, and morning hours fill Sonya with peace. She watches crows fight on rooftops and ignores the way doctors and police downstairs beat the corpses of the builders she has buried with color chalk, cover them with sheets, record something in notebooks, smoke poisoned cigarettes, and finally go to the wind, possibly looking for Sonya.

The autumn sun rises into the blue cold sky, as a shining, dazzling flame, a living creature preparing to jump down. Sonia closes her eyes and sees a huge tree covered with bright, uncolored electric lights, smells of hot resin and glue on the wrappings of New Year's gifts. From the window opened to the Lazure sky comes Santa Claus in his red clothes with a white face and an axe behind his belt. He comes up to the tree of Snegurochka and picks it up by the hair above the ground, can no longer pretend to be dead, the snowflake shakes and screams. Santa Claus looks at her in his mouth and slaps her head against the wall so hard and crunch, until the nose of Snogurka starts to bleed. She's not screaming anymore, but she's groaning in hysterical with her mouth spread, and then out of Grandpa Moroz's nose, there's gonna be something greasy coming down there, and Snegurka has vomited spasms, but Grandpa Moroz's hands are holding her head back, and she's gonna slow down and fall off to the floor, and she's gonna keep shaking and turning like a lizard. Santa Claus takes off his hat and everyone sees that he's got a chicken head, kids get scared and they run away, only Sonja, who comes up to Santa Claus and pulls him by the sleeve, asking for a gift. But Santa Claus only looks at her with his chicken head and laughs.

When he opened his eyes, Sonja saw an old man walking up the balcony looking for a can of pickles that the old man himself had eaten about two years ago. Instead of pickles, he found Sonya and was a little surprised because he forgot how she got to him on the balcony.

" My name is Sonya, Sonia Pavlovna, " says Sonya, as I was getting out of the chair.

" The kefir store was closed, " the old man answers, turning to the balcony door and starting to climb back in and in the room.

" Good, " he is encouraged by Sonya.

Soup was made of bread. Soviet power! " The old man shuts down Sonia's balcony.

" That's good, " says Sonya, again, rubbing her legs on the ground's sleepy hair, dust, and cockroaches.

Without hearing the question, the old man looks Sona in the mouth with his tearing eyes, as he looked Santa Claus in the mouth of Snogurochka in Sonin's dream, now Sonya knows why. She has no reason to repeat the question because a skinny gray cat enters the room and sniffs Sonina's legs, looking for food.

After a while, the old man and Sonya drink tea on a little smoked and dirty kitchen with a burnt glue on the table and a hamstringed sink with a stinking rag on it. The cat walks around Sonny's feet asking for food, and Sonya realizes she only eats cockroaches.

" What do your cockroaches eat? " Sonia asks.

" What they eat, what they eat, what they eat, what they eat, what they eat, and what they eat, " answers the old man. " The bagel eats, " he adds, turning to the empty breadhouse, where there is half a bagel. - Take it, baby, bagel, your teeth are young.

Sonya picks up a hamstrung bagel, on the side of which the cuts are visible, like the prints of the ancient ferns on the crushed earth's rocks, and puts it by a cup of pale, sugarless tea. The bagel is, of course, older than the cat.

" Do you remember Lenina, Grandpa? " she asks, looking through a dark window.

I've never seen Lenina alive.

- Why is he dead?

I'm gonna be sick and I'm gonna die, and you're gonna be sick and you're gonna die, even if you're a little girl.

" I can't believe Lenin died, " says Sonya, looking out the window and scratching the glue with his fingernails.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

" Your old lady will certainly die, " Sonia reasons with confidence. " And Lenin will live forever.

" You, little girl, have remained a pioneer, " wonders the old man.

- Yeah, they didn't have time to take me in.

- Where's your red tie?

" I can't find my tie now, " he's picking up Sonya's glue.

And go to Mavzolei, where your Lenin lies, the body of a log, in the head of a lamp.

You're an old grandpa, and you're a fool, and God can eat you for such stupid things.

God wouldn't eat me, I don't believe in him, if God hadn't let him make soup out of kefir. Here's my old lady, she believes in God, and he's gonna eat her, and at the end of the day, the old man's trying to laugh, but he's snoring.

It's not God's way of eating your old lady, but your old lady's gonna eat you when she dies. And you're wrong about Lenin, he's not dead at all, he's still alive, but you haven't seen him.

I went to him, I wore a hump in my pocket, and he smells like poison from a turtle in a museum.

" Lenin came up and left the coffin and put an artificial doll in the coffin to make everyone think he was dead, " says Sonja. " I know where the real Lenin lives, but I can't find this place. There must be black lakes, deep as wells, because there are holes in the ground, and there's stone wood like a mirror, and it's snowing.

There's no place like this on the ground, and you, kiddo, have to take shots in the back of the head, and my old lady has gone to the clinic before, and now she can't.

- Does your old lady, as you call her, know where Lenin lives, or is she just pretending?

- What are you doing, who told you about Lenin?

- And you, Grandpa, quickly forgot Lenina.

- It's hard for me to remember, I'm old.

And he remembers you, at least he's over a hundred years old, and he sees you eating bread here with a kefir, and you don't see him, and you don't even have a portrait of him. You, Grandpa, you seem to be an old communist, and you're still an asshole, because you don't believe in communism, and you never believed in communism.

" You're a bastard, " says the old man, slowly smoking daddy's knotted venous fingers.

- That's what you want me to do, not to remind you of youth and light communism. I'm gonna take the cat from you, you've got nothing to feed her anyway, and if you want to buy it, I can buy it, Sonia pulls the cement-filtered shirts out of her chest pocket and puts them on the table.

" You can see the cat on the soap, " the old man says, "and in his eyes you can see no sorrow.

Sonia pulls her legs back from under her chair, takes the cat and goes down the hallway into the bedroom, where an old woman who looks out of the window is sitting in a chair. Behind the chair lies her glasses and a folded newspaper.

" Hello, Grandma, " says Sonya, "puts a cat on the floor and comes up to the back of the seat, takes a handkerchief lying on the dresser, and sneaks it over her head. The old woman's darling face is bleeding, she's got a syringe in her mouth, the air that's missing. Sonia's looking closely at the side of her bubbly eyes. " asks Sonya and releases a handkerchief for which an old woman is trying to grab her hands.

- She can barely hear the champagne.

When the forest is stoned again, Sonia kneels into the chair to buy extra support, and the old woman crumbles her face and thinks only of her death. When Sonya's released again, the old woman's brain, flooded with black blood, no longer wants to re-establish contact with the rest of her organs.

The old lady says her hands fall on her stomach, and Sonia pulls her handkerchief out of her wrinkled head and brings it back to the comedian. Sonia leans down to the old woman's face, slightly stretching her open toothless mouth and spit in him. Then she catches a cat, comes up to the window, climbs on the windowsill, and when she opens the fort, she throws the cat out of the ninth floor. After doing so, Sonja closes the fort and leaves the apartment, noting that the old man is still sitting in the kitchen in the same place and smoking papyrosa.

" Goodbye, " says Sonia from the doorstep, an old man can't hear her drowning in memories of his youth and radiant communism.

Going down on a nailed elevator, Sonja finds a corpse that fell on the asphalt of a cat that's bleeding from its mouth, and the skin on its stomach burst. Sitting next to him on his knees, Sonya removes the cat's heart and bites it off the vessels. Then she hides her heart in her mouth and goes out with the sun's cold yards in the direction where you walk for a very long time to the north sea.

Oil lakes

And whosoever desires to hurt them, the fire shall come out of their mouths and devour their enemies; and whosoever desires to hurt them, he shall be slain.

Opening 11.5

Natasha's father was a builder, and his mother was a nurse, and when Natasha was nine years old, his father hamstrung his stomach, tasting a stone at the construction site, and died in hospital. There were few people at the father's funeral, but the wet black asphalt and the steps of the parade were rotten by trampled flowers. Natasha thought they were given to mom and put them in a jug when she gathered the flowers with a cardboard box tonight. But my mom threw away the flowers and soon got married for the second time to a smoked man who treated her in the hospital. Natasha didn't like her mom's new husband and refused to call him father, so her mom punched her in the face with a strong palm.

In fourth grade, Natasha began smoking, and in fifth grade, she began to have sex at her studymate's birthday. However, Natasha's favorite activities were to dance on discotheques and drink vodka. She often got drunk, instinctively trying to get to the bottom of things, and fought with her friends, tasting them for their hair. After the eighth grade, she went to study at the building shop to build a house that her father had not finished, where she had two abortions, and then she started working at the construction site. Natasha put up with men only for the bed, and she hated it at all, and all men called her a whore. On the last night of her life, Natasha drank a lot of liquor and allowed her employees, Dima and Tolik, to fertilize themselves in a long, stupid dump in a dark car bed. During the insemination, all three behaved like animals, roared, ripped, kicked their heads into nonliving objects, sweared and even ripped Natasha's T-shirt. A sweaty and worn-out seed, Natasha fell into a dream similar to that, from which the awakening was terrible. From it, all Natasha remembered was the face of a beautiful white-haired girl with a fixed look, like holes in the plugs, and the horror of death in her head with her clawed bird paws.

Natasha is lying naked on an ice table, covered with a cellophane blanket on her head, and there's a rift on the blanket, and there's a terrible white lamp on the top of it, and Natasha thinks it's already on the other side. The inhuman frost is standing before her like a church with a lot of gorgeous bells, and Natasha's lips begin to move, remembering her sins, and confessing makes her very nauseous. Someone's strong hands pick up Natasha's mice and legs, drag him from the lamp into the dark, put his stomach on cold iron, and tear off the blanket.

" How's the bride? " asks the gentle man's voice. " We're not gonna warm up, we're almost asphyxiated, there's not even enough springs on it, like a living one.

" It would have been a long time before, " answers a younger voice. " Without freckles, what a girl is.

Yeah, this one's not the hot one, the older one laughs.

" You know I can't stand it, " says the young man.

" What sex without a scalpel, " agrees the eldest and hears him walk away slowly, whistling and crisping his shoes over a mud - covered linoleum.

Young, taking Natasha's body from death by ankles, drags her belly to the edge of the table and lowers her legs to the floor. Then, when he takes off his pants, he falls on Natashin's ass, quietly calls her Ludmila, and suddenly turns around, Natasha grabs him by the throat and starts suffocating him. He's trying to push her away from herself, but she looks him in the eye a few times and beats him with her cold and damp, with her fumes on her forehead. A man's nose is bleeding, his pupils roll under the eyelids, and when he stops breathing, Natasha lets him fall to his chest on the table, leans over, and detests the shit out of the dark mucus.

There's another table next door, covered with many dark stab wounds, the naked corpse of an old man who did not believe in Lenin's eternal life. After Sonia left, the old man sat in the kitchen for a long time and then went to the old lady to remind him of his name 20 years ago. Something heavy hit him in the dark hallway, knocked him down and scratched his face with toothless jaws. When he heard the words of Sonia, the old man was afraid and struck the dead woman on the head with her weak fists, but the old woman squashed him and he died, now convinced of Sonia's right. The old woman dragged a knife out of the kitchen and ate the old man raw, remembering the forgotten taste of meat, then climbed out with a knife and a bloody piece in her teeth on the balcony and fell over the railing, thinking she could fly, but she fell and smashed her head, thus gaining eternal peace.

Natasha takes off a dead man's sweater and wears it on herself, and her pants disgust her, and she's naked below her belt dragging a man by the hair in the freezer and smashing a white lamp with her fist. After choosing three men's bodies, one woman and one boy's body, Natasha, subject to an incomprehensible drive, throws his vomit out of his mouth, climbing his legs on the shelves. When the victim's partner comes in with a flashlight, Natasha prevents him from turning on the emergency light, attacks him from behind, and grabs one hand by the throat, throws his fingers out the other's eyes. The man falls with the loud war of the monkey on the floor, drops the torch, and Natasha beats him to the head with his foot all the time until his neck snaps short.

At 5 a.m., a group of six dead men of both sexes appeared in the morgue's yard, a tall bald man armed with an axe, and a young woman in a sweater, who knew Natasha easily, held a metal stick in her hand to drag the corpses back to the end into a sharp hac. The second woman, with a burn on her face, is dripping around in dark colours, and the last man walking is limping because he doesn't have a piece of foot. They are taken to the cabin of a kataphael minibus, the lame being seated behind the wheel, and Natasha being seated in the front seat adjacent to the chemical plant located on the northern outskirts of the city, which has long ceased to poison the environment for financial reasons. They drive empty streets in the dark, the driver is clearly observing the strips of markings, not strapped to Natasha's seatbelts, relaxing, leaning back on the back of the chair, and staring at the shiny lights.

Everything that's happened seems weird to Natasha, but it doesn't scare her, probably because she doesn't believe in her death without finding a reason. In the back, the whirlwind of one of Natasha's resurrected men, who bent in half on the filthy side of a van, groaning from his exorcious intestine of pain. The chryp passes into a deaf hole, the man beats his head into the shell of the car and crawls side by side between the silent comrades sitting on the floor.

" Wait, " says Natasha to the driver, and the bus stops by the side of an empty prospectus. Natasha takes her stick, the other hand of a bucket from under her feet, and climbs out onto a red leafed square of wet land where the maple grows. A man immediately sees a half-naked woman approaching him with a bucket and an iron glove, poorly lit by lanterns, he doesn't like it, but by explaining it by overdose of alcohol, he's just trying to escape to the depths of an unknown alley. When Natasha accelerates the move, he easily catches up to his victim and hits her in the head with a gag, and the man falls, and Natasha smacks his head thoroughly with the marks of the gag. When she sits on the asphalt and puts the edge of the bucket under the blood fountain, she licks and blinds the dark windows of the houses. The place where Natasha milks the victim is far away from the nearest lamp, so even those awake at that time can't see the expression of these eyes.

First the driver drinks out of the bucket, nasty urch, then when the bus touches, Natasha puts it in the salon. A woman wrapped up in a blanket pours blood into a can of canned blood, a frowny boy pulls his palm and repulsively grovels, the rest with a squeamish chauffeur is drunk by a bald man, and the man who crumbles on the floor can no longer take part in a meal, his mouth gushes with something thick and stinky, like pieces of broken intestines, and his roar chokes in this disgusting material, turning into a shuffling whirlwind. At about six o'clock in the morning, when the light is barely visible, the bus stops at the concrete fence of the chemical plant, which has failed in many places.

Sonia came to the factory on foot, which took her a long time, but time meant little to her, and she also had to stay in one of the new neighborhoods through which she walked to kill a seventh-grade student, named Nadia, returning from school, in the parade, in order to get her bots and tights, so that barefoot wouldn't throw herself in the eye. The bots were a little big, but she liked her uniform and her black color, and the stakes were physical, which Sonya didn't like, and they were torn on the back of her right thigh. Nadia, however, wore a long school dress and no one could see a hole while she was alive. Sonia came up to her by the elevator and, grabbed Nadia with both hands by the hair, hit her head hard in the wall. In the elevator, Sonya broke the neck of a unconscious schoolgirl, putting her on the floor and kicking her in the chin. Then she drove to the top floor, dragged Nadia along the iron ladder to the roof, where she removed her boots and panties from the sky and the ground, pulled a black marker from the school ranch, pulled a leaf from the notebook, and wrote a large letter in Nadia's handwriting: ‘ I want to remain virgin forever. Nadya put it near the corpse on a solid tar roof, then she drew a cross on the dead girl's forehead.

After performing these sacrilege, Sonja went to the roof on the other side of the house, where she normally flew to the other side of the house. Moving on to the rooftops of the same houses, as if they were built for people like Sonya, who, unlike birds, could not fly up, she went very far from the scene of her last crime, then went down to the surface of the street and continued her journey.

With no special need for sleep, Sonia still got up by 6:00 p.m. To sleep on a tall old limp whose mistletoe in the branches folded into a big green coma, which served as a nest for the rest of the century with all kinds of shit. Sonia fell asleep with her eyes open, staring at windows in front of the house, which, in turn, lit up, fell asleep, repeating the fate of the vast lamps of outer space in an accelerated rhythm. The wind, with a silky wind, carried unread sheets of the paper on the ground, circling them and a pile of them, raising them high above the ground, long after dark, the rare pink lanterns lit up. Their sad, pale and somewhat dim light, which lit even streets between houses, black courts with silhouettes of semi-flying trees, garbage cans and broken shops where no one else sat on the cold except cats, gave rise to the feeling of limitless death and loneliness that Sonya loved so much. These dark spaces in the shades of the houses reminded her of the stingy unknown that covered her as a child when she walked to her girlfriend, looking at the starry sky, looking at the cold and thinking of the forgotten gloves at home, the beauty of the autumn maples that were seen behind the garden fence, the alien darkness of the ravine-like streets that were falling all over the world, which seemed to her future, the unknown of her, Sonina, fate. She met people with hard-to-read, strange faces, like shadows sliding on the walls of houses, walking out of nowhere and rushing to nowhere, as if they were in the wind, their incomprehensible dark life seemed to Sonya and her future life, and she was scared, little prickly chills of despair were gathering between her scapulas. In the parade where the girlfriend lived, adults sat in the dark at night, red cigarette lights were spinning, lovers licked each other's open mouths with moist tongues, guitars, and smelled of wine. When Sonia called the elevator, she pressed to the joint of his doors, trembling, when someone came down the stairs, as if she could be taken and fired up the dark ladder, to the black sky, where these werewolves lived in their caves cut out in the iceberg of time. One day, a young man walking down the stairs noticed Sonya and stopped by her and asked her her name, and Sonja opened his name, waiting painfully for the elevator she had caused to fall down, and the man laughed quietly, giving Sonya the smell of wine, grabbed her by her shoulders and kissed her forehead, and his lips burned him with the cold of eternal curse and overturned underground churches. And then Sonya realized that the Devil loved her.

At half past eight, Sonia spit out a peeled cat's heart, improved the moment when no one was near the tree, went downstairs and molested the passers-by with a question about where the butcher shop was. Finally, one woman, a bank employee whose lips had been painted with purple lipstick and smelled heavily of perfume and shampoo, showed her the way because she had often visited a meat shop to buy lamb meat for her terrible children.

When Sonia entered the shop, there was no one there but the butcher, whom Kolya called, who, when he saw Sonya, immediately pictured her naked and lying on the cutting table. Sonia went up to the counter and looked at the meat hanging on the wall behind it, and she looked at the meat silently and carefully, as if it were an object of fine art. Kolya also kept quiet, folding his strong hands on his chest and carefully quartering in his imagination Sonya with a large meat knife, roasting pieces of her body on the spinner and eating. The desire to undress, to rape, to slaughter, to cut and eat the girl standing before him was so full of the lazy bear creature Koli that he had difficulty in suppressing the impulse to grab in one hand, soiled in the blood and salad of the cattle, Sonina's hair, and in the second, to start his business.

In particular, Kola was given slowly crawling carcases through the bloody cuts, living and beautiful eyes of the girls, who somehow even made him swallow saliva. Other than that, he saw her body hanging from her head to her lungs, hanging from her mouth on a hook, torn from the front, so that he could see the blue breathing organs leading from her head to her lungs, the girl's hair was stained with a sticky red mass, and the remaining blood was running out of blood, running down Sonya's legs into the puddle on the floor.

" Tell me, where are the black lakes? " Sonia asked, and Koli's heavy body was shaking. " I need black lakes, " Sonia clearly repeated, looking right into his watery eyes.

Kolyu was surrounded by a vague fear. He used to think that no one else knew about black lakes, bottomless holes in the grass of suburban tundra, where Kolya was shoving out of the box at night his vile works of bones and insides of torn children, filled with slaughtered animal blood, which Kolya was trying to replace with the blood of little human beings that he was spilling. He believed that there were powerful demons living in black-covered stone towers in the middle of the lakes, all-out gifts that would give him the power to become immortal.

" Did you eat a man? " Sonia asked with a dark threat.

Kolya grabbed an axe from the table and threw it into Sona's head, but he didn't, because Sonja turned aside, and the axe hit the stone wall of the shop, kicking a dent the size of a fist into a brick.

- I'm gonna blow your brains off, and I'm gonna burrow up Kolya and move on to Sonya with a knife, cutting off her way to a door that I just locked on a lock.

But Sonya didn't think to run.

" You'd better tell me nicely, " she kindly asked Kolya.

" My wife, Lucy, from a girl, made some dumplings a week ago, "stopped for Cole's memory. " Very good dumplings came out, just finished. And you're not gonna taste good, you're gonna be good for cutlets, you're good for peppers, I see as a kid, I know what it's best to cook.

Kolya wanted to move on, but she didn't, because Sonia spent a third of her cat's soul throwing fire into his stomach with a glass of fire that burned Kolya through and threw a fountain of blood and boiled abdominal fat behind him. Kolya dropped the knife and fell back on the floor of the shop, grabbing his arms behind his abdomen, followed by a stinking couple's exhaust, bubbling blood mixed with the contents of the intestine.

- Ah, "he blazed Kolya with pain and fear for his gut.

" Where are the lakes? " Sonia quietly repeated her original question, leaning over a distorted butcher's face. " If you say so, I'll cure you.

- Outside the city... In the fields... Near the chemical plant... - curling up, trying to show Kol's forehead direction.

- Which side of the world?

Instead of answering, Kolya started rolling from side to side, continuing wildly tossing.

" If you face the rising sun, " Sonia slowly said. " Where do you want to go?

To the left, Kolya began to ripen, and his face gradually began to die.

- It means north.

- Help me, girl... Help me, girl... -..scape Kohl, throwing his head back from his inhuman pain.

" Of course I'll help you, since I promised, " said Sonia calmly.

Kolya took his shaking hands from a bloody hole in his stomach, and his eyes, crying because of the pain, complained about Sonya, and she kicked him with force into the defenseless bleeding belly. Shot with a short water sound, a fan of blood spatter from a wet, messed-up mess on Koli's abdomen, screaming again, grabbed by the belly and toasted by Koli's leg, shaking the walls of the butcher's shop.

" You'll die before nightfall, " said Sonya, turning to the door.

With these words, Sonia pushed away the bolt and, when she came across the dark wind that hit her in the face, turned her back in the back. Some man on the street went after her, but he didn't see a soul in the dark lane anymore.

Only in the deep part of the night, tired of the long journey and the battle with Sonya's butcher finally reaches the chemical plant. It rises in the middle of the dark autumn fields as a monstrous city of antiquity that has fallen into the ruins of time. The star sky gathers over huge cylinders of gas storage tanks and the ruins of dead bodies, and the Sonja finds a failure in a fence drawn by rows of barbed wire and enters the inner yard. The dark buildings smell of dampness and some caustic gas that makes Sonia scratch in the throat. She almost stepped on a dog's dead body lying in the middle of the yard, halfway into the sand like a dead fish popping up out of the ground. In the shredded tanks on rusty stands and a long three-storey building with broken windows in the windows, the lonely wind groans long.

In parallel with this building, there is another building, and on the passageway between them, Sonja goes to the central square, where there is a built-up main office with pipes going into the sky, huge as a cathedral. Sonia gets on a rusty pipe marked by sand and starts to think.

As long as she thinks, there's a shadow coming out of the main building and holding on to the wall itself, she's getting close to Sona. He is a former PTU student number 12 Alexei, who once climbed into the main shop to test his own self-made bomb of mass destruction, but who stumbled, fell through a drain mine into a basement and flew through an iron well without a small size of 37 meters, like Alice heading for the land of miracles. Shortly before the scary blow in Alexei's floor, he saw a pilgrim figure of a dead red Armenian riding on a Pylinian battle horse, whose stone hoofs were shaken by the fragile mast of the night fields. The boy &apos; s brain sprayed walls and floors at a significant distance from the site of his fall, and there was no one to lick it, since even rats adapted to the plant could not get into the poisoned drain. The chemical substances that had merged in the underground for many years had formed a fossilized fallout on the floor, which had reacted with infiltration water, causing toxic gaseous vapours to fill the entire main centre building with poorly visible green fog throughout the plant and reaching the outskirts of the city, which often led to the birth of children without legs or hands, or even without head. But the poison was beneficial to Alexei, and after a few days he was alive, up, and for months he wandered through the dark labyrinths of the runoff, feeding on rats and insects. Then he found a rusty door through which death workers were to go down to clean up possible clots in the plum system, went to the underground floor of the workshop and lived there. Alexei killed roaming children in the abandoned industrial zone, or far away from their masters during the walk of domestic dogs, preserved them with poison and slowly ate. One girl killed by a brick in spring, Alexei dragged to her second-born place, and soon she really got up, but one hand of hers didn't listen anymore, dried up and fell to half her forearm, so instead she had to spin a piece of rusty gland with wire instead, but Alexei was nothing, and Tanya, as a girl was called, became a faithful friend of his life. In time, they were joined by Tanya's older sister, Luba, who was very longing for her, and then Kostik, a former friend of Alexei's, so there were four of them.

While Alexei sneaks up on Sona, Luba gushes rats caught in the dungeon at the second level of the main shop, sitting by a rusty can, burning a blue fire, and one-handed Tanya and Kostik went to the fields to look for a fall. After stopping a few metres from Sonya, Alexei pulls out a piece of chain with a nut at the end that is going to kill a girl sitting on a pipe. The chain barely hears the wind whistle, and Sonia turns her head towards a dark stripe under the wall of Alexei's building. Her eyes emit some strange light in the dark, invisible to an ordinary man who makes Alexei uncomfortable. The great horror suddenly fills him with terror in front of some unknown, but cold-blooded torment, and he can't imagine who and how he's gonna torment him, but it only makes him scarier. And then he realizes that these are Sonya's thoughts, which he hears because of the long-term effects of poison, as he hears sometimes the thoughts of rats running from him into the dark.

Alexei snorted, the gun fell out of his hand, and the cold enters his banished body, like diving into a chop. And he heard again the heavy, broken ground, the steps of the Pilgrim horse with the skulls on the skull, walking in the fields, the eyes of Sony approaching him, he wants to scream, but he can't.

" Hello, Alyosha, " Sonia says, while Alexei continues to hear her thoughts, which are not translated into words, he would like not to hear them, but he's cold and he can't stop. These are the sounds of a foreign language, black dots and lines on brown tissue, a language spoken by creatures whose mother is death. Sonia smiles, and that smile makes Alexey so cough up that his mouth is thinly snorted by a dark bloodline.

" Go away, you asshole, " he says with a foreign voice, having difficulty controlling the muscles of his mouth.

- Don't swear, dear Alyosha, "Sonia says nicely by touching his filthy, sticky hair." - Don't swear, tell me better how you live here. What are you doing here in the long cold nights, who are your friends, dear Alyosha, tell me, I want to know.

- Rat eats, makes Alexei look crazy.

- Who's that girl, who's out there frying rats?

I killed her, I killed her, I killed her, I killed her, she lived in the mine, and I killed Tanku with a brick, and I killed Kostika and I with the bricks, and then they lived in the mine, too.

Who lives in the mine?

" No one, " Alexei says, "and his lips turn blue somehow into colours covered in white plums.

What do you think the bodies are coming from?

- I don't fucking know him.

- Okay, let's go eat rats, - Sonya's picking up the nut and giving it to Alexei.

Soon Sonja, Alexei, and Luba sit on the iron floor of the second floor of the main shop, open inside the building, eating roasted rats, throwing the bones through the railing to the first floor. Luba doesn't have a upper lip because she's turned away, and when she talks, she holds her lower lip to her upper teeth.

" And then I hit him in the head and killed him, " he kept telling Alexei. " And if he hadn't tripped and fell, I would have lured him into the underground floor and killed him there.

" We've been eating it for two weeks, " adds Luba in a shy way, sucking on the rat bone.

Then the police came, but we did sit in the weedhouse, and no one's going to the weedhouse, and you're gonna die, and the boner shot himself and shoots him with nails, and the nails in the weed at night sticking in the floor. He killed such a healthy dog the other day.

" Tanki has a poisonous crowbar, " adds Luba again. " She's very good at throwing it, right in the head.

" You live well here, " notes Sonya, turning his back on the wall.

There is a silence broken only by the crisp chatter sitting next to the fire of the Edoks.

" Who are you going to be? " asks Alexei, who is not feeling well for some reason.

My name is Sonya, and I came here from far away to find Lenina.

" Where does Lenin live? " asks Luba.

The way to him lies through a field over which the sun does not shine, through the stone forest and the black lakes.

The lakes are black, they're here, Luba's coming back to life.

- Is there a tower in the middle of the lakes?

And there's a tower, black and black, and Luba finishes her rat and wipes her hands on the dress.

" Then the first scary mascot must be buried nearby, " she says with a missing voice.

" What is it? " he quietly asks Lyuba, feeling that it's not a good thing.

It's a secret, but we have to find him, my little friends.

" Who is the guard of the talisman? " comes into Alexei's conversation. His rotten gut is being carried away by a convulsor. It was better for him never to meet Sonya.

" I don't know for sure, " shakes Sonya's shoulders.

" I saw him, " says Alexei with a grumpy voice. " He's a huge man on the horse, and when he goes, the whole earth shakes, and in his hand is a sword of fire, as healthy as a poppole.

Sonia closes her eyes, trying not to think about the guard.

- I think they're following my lead.

Alexei's looking through the black window.

" Vampires, " Sonia says, "and without opening his eyes, he takes off the bots. " We're gonna have to attack them.

By sending Lubu to search for Kostik and one-handed Tanya, Sonya and Alexei enter the square in front of the main shop. The star sky spans them, and the wind spins in its spaciousness, as if the shadows of the spirals were brought up dark, torn away from the earth by the fragrances of all possible matter. A lot of long, curved worlds stand still against a huge, dark building looking at the sky, a girl and a boy.

" They're already here, " Sonia finally says, "not wanting to talk about eternity. " It's gonna be a tough fight.

- How about hiding in the pothole?

Why are you snoring like that, Alyosha?

" The mouth of the poison has dried up, " Alexei answers with a dark response, rubbing a dirty hand on his throat. " We eat poison and meat to strengthen the body.

At the opposite end of the passage between the warehouses from where Sonja came, there are signs of figures moving toward vampires. Next comes Natasha with his glove, just behind him, a lame driver in a homemade rag skirt, with a broken piece of iron in his hand and a sticky bucket over his head to replace him with a helmet. Next comes a large, bald man with no clothes, armed with an ax and wrapped in a blanket, a woman with a burnt half face holding a piece of rusty pipe in her right hand. A naked boy carrying a pebble by the side of the side of the road, a sixth vampire, who was tormented in the bus's gut, is already decomposing in a rash.

Sonia is waiting for them to approach, lighting up the place in front of him with a can of black water in his hand. The rest of the vampires are trying to keep up with the leader.

When Natasha runs up to Sona, Alexei goes sideways, and Sonya puts burning black water in her chest. Natasha's sweater is covered with flames, and the gag hits the ground near Sonia's back jumping. Crazy crying, Natasha starts spinning around blindly, some of which are smashing brick fragments out of the wall of the building. Sonia retreats inside the building, where a roaring bald man with an ax bursts into the axe. With a sharp turn of the ladder, Sonia opens his hand, from which a blinding light bursts. The bald body stumbles, with a violent roar on Sonya, both fall off the stairs, but in the air Sonya turns out from under the vampire, and it's rocked to the concrete floor of the underground floor, breaks through the back of a railing, protecting the first floor from the pit and crashing into the bottom with a cod. By making a narrow circle in the air, Sonja goes down next to him and picks up an axe that flies away. When you hit the whole breast of the concrete, the bald one breaks two ribs and his arm, and when you're deaf, you can barely climb up fours, and then Sonia chops, with two hands putting an ax over his head. The bald head makes a crisp sound under an axe, and the vampire's body falls down on the floor, twitching in convulsions, desperate blows of the Sonia Axe smashing the tenderloin' neck wide open for the foot support.

As he climbs upstairs, Sonja listens to the terrible screaming of Natasha, which is devoured by the burning curse of poisoned lakes, and the iron blows to iron, accompanied by the roar of a lame driver and the squeezing of Alexei. When she separates herself from the dark wall, a woman and a half faces slaps a trumpet like a ponytail into the place where Sonya's head was just found. With his hand pulled to Sonya's rails, the fire blade slits the woman's belly with a plaid. The dark yellow stream dries on Sonya's feet, swinging, the woman puts the pipe over her head with both her hands and falls face down on the floor, dropping her weapon. Sonya's hand is torn apart by the inexorable pain, and when she squeaks, she cannot stand straight for a while to start cutting a long-haired head with an axe.

When it finally reaches the square, Alexei, injured by a gland in the shoulder, climbs through the stack of rusty pipes to a broken window, chased by a lame driver with a bucket on his head. The bucket has already saved the lame man twice from being hit by a nut, but the boy with the stone hasn't moved away, and he's fallen behind, stabbing a piece of bone out of his head. The boy died of a stabbing to the side, which is still visible on his naked body in the form of a dark bleed. Sonia hits at the back of a young man's picking-up, and a short deaf groan hits him on the head with an axe, cutting off a piece of hand stuck in her. The boy bends to the impact and gets kicked into the blood-stained side, knocking him down from his feet to the ground, the whistle of the ax and the crunch of the bladed back of the neck completes the fight.

Alexei's fate, however, is sad, and he never reaches the window when the lame takes out his ridge with his gland, and Alexei slips off the stack of pipes, breaking his shoulder and kicking his teeth out of his face. Sonya could have come to his rescue, but finally, dealing with the fire, Natasha, covered with charred sweater whips sticking to the meat under the burnt skin, starts her attack again with roaring. Sonia goes back and accumulates the rest of the cat's energy, but suddenly hears a sharp battle whistle, and a crowbar thrown by a single-handed Tanya hits Natasha in the head. Natasha has a hard time holding on to her feet, taking a few steps away, and her face is bleeding.

The driver doesn't have time to strike Alexei, either, because he's got a poisoned nail in his chest, released by Bones from a self-gun. Iron blows Alexei's head and he carves sparks out of rusty pipes. Crazy of the pain, Alexei crawls away, trying to hide himself in the shadow of the wall, but the next blow to the head hits him, he groans on the ground, turning his face to the sky, and a limped-up limp with a face crippled from the pain, stabs the iron into his bloody mouth, then twists it like a jack, tearing the boy's neck, so you can see the black roots of Alexey's throat.

Meanwhile, Natasha turns to Sona sideways and makes several scooping moves in the air and runs to Kostika, who rushes into his self - fire with two nails. The boy's swollen fingers can't handle the spring for a long time, but when Natasha is on the run, both nails with rabid force point-blank through her nose and go deep into her face, twitching Natasha's head back and poking up the dark blood jellyfish. By inertia, the smashing blow of the gag smashes Kostika's head and folds his neck, the hard edge rips out a part of his face along with the flow of blood, and he falls like a bump into the mud. Natasha loses her balance and falls down on her knees, issuing the wrong whirlwind, the wrong coolness, and there's blood flowing between the nails in her face. She's been kneeling in the mud for a while, leaning on a glove and looking at the main building, seeing his death home in it, until the young Luba hits her twice with a wrench in her ear, and then Natasha falls heavy off her knees.

The last remaining vampire at first limps unconvincingly towards Sonya, but when he sees the leader's death, he turns towards the abandoned bus. A moving figure of a lame driver can barely reach the middle of the passage between warehouse buildings when the poison of a nail stuck in his chest begins to turn his vomiting spasms, he falls sideways and sees Sonia tired in the midst of the star snow, holding an axe in his hand. Her silhouette, brightened by some stars, melts away, blending with damp darkness. Having gathered the last forces, the lame crawl to the car, clinging their hands to the ground and the dirty beams of dead grass growing on the body of an inhospitable planet. Sonia hits him at a rift in a concrete fence and cuts an axe for a long time until she can't hit a bucket, so she smashes a lame knight's head.

Sonia sits next to the enemy's body in the mud. Her legs, her hands, and her dress are covered with fat, dark blood from defeated vampires, and she closes her eyes and her face becomes completely white like a doll's.

When the cold sky shines with the pale pink paint of the sunrise, Sonia slowly sticks her feet in the mud, drags the body of the lame into the rash and throws it in the sand. She's sad to see a bus that she can't fix, and she's headed to the main shop, and the boy and Natasha's bodies are still lying in the square. The wind breezes the hair, pulling it over a bent hand, the brush of which is buried in a puddle of blood drained from the head, and the sonia takes the body of the boy's armpit and drags him inside the workshop. There she finds the two girls sitting on the iron floor at the bodies of Kostik and Alexei, who rubble the laceration on the face of Kostika with poison, taking it with a handful from the bottom, and the bone shakes and snores. Tanya crying silently, tears flowing down her unwashed cheeks, cold as the first drops of rain.

By throwing the boy down the railing, Sonja brings the dead woman wrapped in the hood after him, and she hears the body hit the concrete.

" For as long as it's not a rash, it doesn't move, " says Tanya's lost tears, looking dumb at Alexei. " It's all because of you, you fucking bastard, you bastard.

Sonia takes off her dress, tights, and stays in her underwear, stares at Alexei's deformed face, who fought for her.

" He's dead," she says. "But he fought like a real hero, and the time will come when the dead children will rise from the earth, and he will be one of the first. Don't cry about him, Tanya. He won his future. Death took him as a pioneer, and she has the right to do so.

" What other pioneers? " asked Tanya, looking at Alexei's face to find familiar features there, and her tears were dripping into the boy's torn mouth.

" Real pioneers don't die," Sonia comes to Tanya, sits next to her and hugs the girl by the neck, kisses the cheek. " They carry guards in the stone forest, waiting for a bright future. He's already standing there, your Alyosha, wearing a new red tie and holding a salute.

Tanya doesn't believe rubbing tears on the back of his brush.

The truth is, Sonia kisses Tanya again and leans on her cheek, looking behind her back.

" Then I'll come with you, " Tanya says.

Only a real pioneer can enter a stone forest.

- And you?

I'm a pioneer, I've been accepted as a pioneer, only I don't have a tie, I've lost it.

- How am I supposed to be a pioneer now?

Now it's hard, no Communists or Comsomolians will find you anywhere, except for death, there's no one here to take you as a pioneer.

- Then kill me, you might be able to.

- Come on, Tanečka, it's supposed to be hero death, that it's good that I'm gonna kill you.

In the silence that has come, only the painful snoring of the wounded Kostik is heard.

" Then I'll just go with you, " Tanya says quietly.

If you want to go, that's the only way it's gonna be scary.

" I'm not afraid of anything, " Tanya says in his missing voice.

Then tell me about the dungeon.

Why they get up, I don't know, and there, in the dark, maybe there's someone but us.

" I saw, " says Luba all of a sudden. " When I went to poison nails, I saw something moving in the dark, by the floor, like a dog.

" What did it look like? " Sonia asks.

- It was very dark.

- Where, remember?

- Right down the hall that leads to the bedroom.

- Where's it going?

"We're the place where the dead are put, the bedroom is called," Tanya explains. "The poisons are the most important. There comes a straight corridor with round walls in the dungeon. I remember when Alyosha Ljubka and I were talking, and I felt like something was coming after us, but I haven't turned around in a while, I haven't seen anything.

And Kostik also said, "Luba's meeting again, "that it's like there's something living under the ground, but it's not on the floor, it's walking down the ceiling, and he's shooting at it once, and the nails don't take it.

" I thought you had a way down here, " Sonia says. " I'm gonna have to look for him. They probably know the way to the stone forest. We need more fire, the underground people are only afraid of fire, Tanya, let's go get some black water.

Alexei is buried in the ground near the wall of the warehouse, Tanya is no longer crying, she puts Alexei in one hand with his cock on a chain, and in the other with a handful of poison. They stand silent over the grave all four of them, healed by the living poison, Bonek holds his hand around his neck.

Natasha's body is being dragged into a rash, and Natasha is very heavy and leaves a stake in the dirt, and she's buried in the ground, and Sonya and Tanya are walking down the water to the nearest lake. It's already morning, the dark sun is disappearing in the damp clouds, the clouds crawling from the west, where the horizon is full of their gray front.

" It's gonna rain, " says Tanya, who doesn't really care about the rain.

The wind can barely see the oily surface of oil water, and the lakes are surrounded by a wide strip of brown soil on which the grass does not grow. From here, you can see a tower on the other side of the water, built from a large black brick. From the lake to the plant is a silver-coated sewage pipe that, in the lifetime of the plant, dumped chemical waste into once ordinary meadow lakes until all life around them ended, the grass died, the grove stopped growing and the birds nested. When the time lost by man finally stopped leaking in this place, the workers of an unknown agency built a black tower in the middle of the field, a silent bastion on the border with eternity.

The people in the surrounding areas of the city preferred to avoid a cursed place. It was said that there were freaking babies around the tower at night who lived only within the walls of a nearby hospital, and that a boy who was wandering through the fields of the cold winter night saw a bird sitting on top of the tower with long goat horns that was scrubbing stones from the tower.

It was also said that someone lived in black lakes and wept in the field at night like a child, which was almost pure truth, because a girl named Lisa lived in one of the lakes, who was raped by an unknown man in the back, strangled and cut her belly button, and then drove her away in a car and dropped into a lake with a rusty wheel from a truck on her neck. Lisa enjoyed living in an empty water, especially since she did not feel the need to breathe any more, as she was climbing into a nest in a lake hole when the cold came, and at a warm time she was eating at night in fields of grasshoppers and sleeping birds, and eating, not crying, but singing on the shore of her lake, especially on a full moon, and it was a thin girl's song about the beauty of the dark spaces drowned in the deep, filled with cool, smelling flowers and stars, the unknowing people would take the crying of an unsatisfied soul. Lisa was particularly romantically affected by the absence of her own belly button, which made her feel confident of the eternity of her existence before and after her death.

Sonia, who comes after the water, immediately senses the existence of Lisa on the most visible traces of a week ago on the ground and a specific odor. She lay on her stomach face to the water and looked down into the lake, softly spiced, and Tanya was afraid to touch her with a can of hot water. Soon, there's a bright spot in the dark cloud of the lake, and Lisa doesn't make it to the surface, letting black water out of her chest through her mouth. It can be seen that in life, when fatal paleness had not yet touched her face, she could not count on the beauty of the present.

" I'm sorry, Lisa, " Sonia modestly starts on her knees, "which disturbed your sleep, but you know, it's nice to talk to someone who can understand and comfort you. You, Lisa, aren't you a lump?

Lisa's white eyes are a passing alarm. Only she's gonna just swim back into her hole, like a memory of almost erased pain, possibly still in the future, makes her smile bitterly.

" Not anymore, girl, I stopped being a lump when the comsomol ceased to exist, " she suddenly answers with a melodic voice.

It's too bad if you could help the poor girl, Sonia shows her eyes toward Tanya, who, by holding a bucket to the chest with her iron hand, is scared and angry on the mermaid, who really wants to be a pioneer. Believe me, she's a good girl, and if she went to school, she would certainly be an excellent student and activist.

- Oh, it's all in the past, sweet girl. - Lisa's swinging in the water with her graceful ballet hand.

- What are you... What's your name?

- Lisa.

- What a beautiful name you have. So, Lisa, think of the right, can something big, can it be that Sonya's hands are splashing away like she wants to do the sun, something so big and full of life suddenly take and die, disappear without a trace? 'Cause we're small compared to comsomol, Lisa, and we can't disappear, because we exist with you, sweet Lisa. What so many people believed in, could not die, whether they wanted it as before or not, leave the crow on the field and it will come to life. And the comsomol is to you, Lisa, not a crow, but a lot more. Did you read The Young Guard?

" Yeah, I read, " says Lisa, holding up the unhinged memories of her past days, the cherries blooming in May in front of the school building, the shower reading hall of the library, where the mysterious, buzzy fly, silence, the tick of grandmother's watches above the floor, the sleepy fly of moth from the dressing cabinet to the hallway, and the cool wind on the tennis of her bike descending into the yard.

In a world where nothing happens for nothing, so it's there, it's there, it's there, it's there, it's there, it's got to be found.

But I don't want to go back to a beautiful past, even if it becomes the future. I like the twilight and the graveyard coolness of the present, his lanterns going out, the foliage and the hopeless sadness of the night, and I like the loneliness.

I want to be a magician.

" You'll probably die, brave girl, " says Lisa enthralledly. " I love your destiny.

There's silence, everyone thinks about their own, and the one standing with Tanya's bucket thinks about fate.

" Now I think it's time for me to swim, " says Lisa.

" Have you noticed anything very unusual around your lakes, Lisa? " asks Sonya, whose face is becoming serious. " Does anything surprise you?

" Except the light above the groves, " Lisa answers briefly. " I don't know where it came from. If you climb the hill in the cloudy night, you can see the white light in the north where the forest starts, so weak that the living, the bad-seeing in the dark, can't see it, but I can see it. I think it's glowing in the woods.

Thank you, Lisa, I think that's what I'm looking for.

" You're not afraid to live here, " Tanya asks the mermaid.

There, under the water, the fire can't live, girl, there's nothing there but me, there's a lot of traces of those who came to me, but they're all dead. Farewell, "Lisa turns around, and with strong swings of hands and legs goes into black, and Tanya looks after her while Sonya washes his hands and feet in the lake, carefully flushing the blood stain from the skin. On her way back, she turns north once.

" What, does the forest really start there? " she asks Tanya.

It's not far from here, it's just he's down there and we can't see from here.

- Anyway, we have to wait until nightfall if we want to see him.

" Sonia... " asks Tanya after a long silence, "why do you get fire out of your hand?

" I sucked the cat's heart out, " Sonia answers.

- Can I do that, too?

- I don't think so, you're different.

When they get to the plant, it starts raining.

The first scary talisman.

And I saw a kind of glass sea mixed with fire.

Opening 15.2

Here, I will do what they come and bow before your feet, and they will know that I have loved you...

Opening 3.9

- I'll take it from here.

Sonia stands in the wall of a small underground tank with a low ceiling, where a hole with washed tons of sewage is melted from its edges, and holds a tin bucket with burning oil water in its hand. She's wearing pants, a plaid shirt, and a jacket that Tanya gave her from the marauder's stock of little plant residents.

" There's a hole in the pipe going down, and then it's straight and split, " Tanya says quietly. " There's a lot of rats coming from there.

" Goodbye, Tanya. " If I don't come back by tonight, I'll be gone forever, "Sonia says, without any paphos, and drowning in eternal darkness.

Tanya stands and watches the light of the burning bucket melt under the ground. Then she goes to the opposite wall, sits on the floor, leaning on her back, and waits, looking at the sleepless eyes in the hole where Sonya went. She thinks of a stone forest, with mirror trunks reflecting clouds in the sky, and she thinks of Alexei, who carries a pioneer watch among the snowless. Huge and indestructible, like a mountain, love fills it with a small, one-handed creature. Love for someone she never knew in her life, who killed her and, against her will, forced her to live again, distorted and full of hatred, love that knows neither the cause nor the end, like space wasting the fire banks of a solar star.

Sonia's been wandering through the pipes for a long time, falling further and further into the earth's abyss. It finds narrow steps that it cannot climb, rusted hatches in the ceiling of pipes and rinsed skeletons of workers in a decayed specialty who were victims of a long-standing repair disaster, when a alkaline river came out of the broken water with a shiny wreath and took the air from its fruitless iron straps in the walls of the creators &apos; pipes. Here, in the depths of space once again lost by man, everything has returned to its own circles, day and night do not change more than each other, and time is measured only by generations of rats whose remains, mixed with sand, flow into the dried metal layers of pipes.

Sonja is oriented towards the smell, the terrible smell of a world where people have not yet entered, even though the world existed long before them and will exist even after the last person dies. The smell is scattered throughout the sewage system, and Sonia returns several times to the same places, making signs on the brown walls with a piece of yellow brick. Finally, she finds a hatch in the wall of the pipe behind which the forest goes down into a small cell, and at the bottom of the cell, there's a hole in the well with the bars of the steps. Sonja puts a bucket on the floor of the camera, goes down on his knees and breathes from the well, smells coming from there.

By hanging a bucket on his forearm and looking down into the dark, Sonia carefully goes down the steps, intercepting rusted straps with his hands. She suddenly sees the reflection of her fire in a slow-moving subterranean river, and the well breaks off over an iron bridge hanging by the water itself on the pillars. The river is not the creation of human hands; the walls of the mermaid are made of ordinary brown clay with traces of debris. A few metres above the current, Sonya sees a mound formed from the wall of clay. Sonia is convinced that the depth of the river is barely above her knees, comes down from the bridge and goes down to the bottom against the low current of the water.

They're horizontal on the wall behind the motel, like they're lying in the air, two of them, and they're not taller than Sonya, and their white mold faces are cut off by leather surges that give rise to weird terror. Their heads are covered with black needles instead of hair. Their narrow black eyes are devoid of pupils and do not reflect fire like matte plastic. They look more like chewing iron than living creatures. A sharp headache marks the beginning of telepathic contact with an underground people who can't speak.

The underground people express the contempt of Sonina for the stupidity that brought her here, because Sonya's existence is not possible here because of the large number of people who have already ceased to exist here. Sonya's death is inevitable, and without understanding it, she is contemptible.

The road to the stone forest, Sonya answers them silently, the road to the stone forest.

The lack of understanding of the purpose of Sonny's movement towards the stone forest is encountered in an area of its inner essence, which is not accessible to the brain organs of the underground people. Inhumans put Sonya in a sudden telepathic attack, which makes her confused in the sand, closing her eyes, and trying to remember where she is. There's a little burning fluid coming out of the cosine of the bucket that was put into the river, and it's gonna go out fast. When she thinks of herself, Sonya sees that the Inhumans are approaching her, she really wants to throw fire at them, but she doesn't, and they're trying to kill Sonya by tearing her brains apart, but they can't. Then they realize Sonya's not human.

You don't look like the living, you don't look like those who walk after death.

The road to the stone forest, Sonia answers them silently, do you know about it?

We know about her.

Sonia closes her eyes with her hand and reveals her identity to the outsiders.

Their awful faces are creeping out of fear.

What are you afraid of, Sonia asks, and the black ball slowly turns inside.

Inhumans are desperately trying to kill Sonya. Ice diamond screws pop into Sony's head, and her mouth is bleeding, but she's already starting to say things she doesn't know. Ice screws fall into snow dust.

Let us go, mistress.

Stone forest, repeats Sonia's question.

In front of her eyes, there's a field of rotten stogs, a lonely tree at the edge of the hamstrung and a abandoned tractor at the tree.

Sonia spits blood and the mortal crust of the Inhumans rips her skin off on the brush of her right hand, covering her eyes.

Through the power of moving naughty legs, Sonja returns without turning to the place where the bodies of the underground creatures remain, she knows what's happening to them now, but she doesn't want to see it. It is very difficult for her to climb the wall of the well up, and she stops and rests several times, holding her breast to the straps and closing her eyes.

Sonia comes out of a hole in the wall, opposite which Tanya sits in the middle of the night, her face cuffed with fatigue, and the water is barely burning at the bottom of the bucket. He and Tanya hug each other, and a bucket with a knock falls out of Sonya's loose fingers.

Falling down on the metal floor of a bonfire, where any rat caught in fun is roasted, Sonia falls into a dream full of interlocking branches between which balls of pale flowers are floating, covered with an icy chunk of inexhaustible flame.

Later in the evening, Sonya and Tanya are on their way, their faces are punctured by the cold rain in the dark. In a darkness unlighted by stars, Sonja clearly sees the brightness that Lisa was talking about, similar to the light of a thin month that fell into a deep forest ravine. The trackers curl up Lizino's lake and climb up to the floor of the hill, where you can see the forest on the other side of the field, and the sun's staring into the dark and no one knows what it sees there.

Finally, she starts coming down the hill, and the stones bite her by the bare feet. Sonia left Ljubé in return for the dangerous razor that was once found in the landfill, which is now carefully wrapped in a rag in the pocket of Sonina's jacket. Sonia likes the razor very much, because she's always dreamed of such a razor, with a comfortable plastic pen and a sharp blade, a little rusty, like dried blood. Such a razor is cut well, leaving thin stripes of acute pain with its cool blade. Don't forget that her mentors, life and death, are just as rude as baby cookie dealers.

Sniffing with the bad rain, the girls dive into a forest that wipes out the memory of a man who leaves him with every notion of the sides of the light and the location of the cities. Their faces sink into the sea of dampness, soaking in the smells of rotten grass, wet bark, and the trembling heart of fallen trunks. Like little fairies, they slide in the dark on a narrow path spinning among trees, lonely and excluded from the world, from which no help, no pity, no love are expected.

White light blooms ahead as a piece of distant sunrise, and Sonya feels awe-awesome, mixed with a cold trembling of fear, approaching the mascot. She's not even trying to imagine what he's like, and what she's gonna do to him when she finds him, she just decides to see him and she can disappear forever. To touch the wet surface of your eyes to this pure light, to feel the transparent flame of freedom lick your heart gently. Ah, no one can know how beautiful the future that must never come... And Sonya also thinks of a guard... A giant horseman on a black horse... A red star burning on his wake-up call. About the ruthless look of the eternal eyes, about the flames of a sword that splits the two nights of the worlds.

Sonia stops Tanya by touching her hand, she sees a little polka ahead with a tree growing in the middle, and there's a ghost lantern in his crown.

Sonia carefully inhales the autumn air and listens closely in the sounds of rain. Sonia stays still, the drops of rain flow down her face like drops of cold sweat. As Sonia leans on the tree trunk, it is as if it merges with it, turning into a forester, feels the movement of worms deep in the soil, the breath of a protein folded into a duple, the drop of drops in branches, the boiling rotting of wet leaves that have fallen. But nothing more, and yet something bothers her, she pushes her hand on Tanya's shoulder, and she kneels in the grass, and then Sonya slowly sneaks into the tree, picking every step. At the halfway point, she stops again because the smell suddenly gets sharp. Too much for the mouse. Sonia carefully scans with the eyes of the bushes from where the smell comes from. And finally she sees.

- Wait, he's making a silent voice as soon as Sonia pulls her leg back.

Two shadows come up from the bushes, and now Sonya hears their heavy breathing clearly, so they've never breathed before.

"Go ahead," the same voice orders. Sonia goes forward, climbing the field. She hears one following her. His steps are almost silent, and then there's a sharp sound behind her, where Tanya remains. Shoots the silence of the mouth, the second punches it in the eyes, the third and fourth fills it with salty blood, the second enemy standing there, among the bushes, swears by the mat. Sonia's back stabbing the cutter's ass.

" Who was with you? " asks the rash voice.

- Girlfriend.

- What were you doing in the woods?

Thought we'd cut the corner, Sonya's lying.

- Take off your jacket.

Sonya's taking off her jacket.

- Turn your face.

Sonia turns his face, and there's an overgrown beard and a mixed hair with a slit in his hands, and he's wearing a spinning soldier's waist and an army ear with a star. The second man, dressed in a brown cape, comes out of the bushes, he's got a gun in his hand.

" She's gone, you bastard," he says. His voice isn't so squishy, his face is brushy, he's swollen, and he's taller than his first.

There's a stump, there's a gunfight, there's a gunfight, and this bastard needs to be judged.

She's just a kid, and she's a little girl, and she's got a pop in the back of her head, and she's ready, and she's just gonna jump.

I was already working at the factory when I was a kid.

- So, what, get her into the lair?

- We'll get to the agreed place, and then we'll see.

Tall with annoyance charles in the grass.

Then let's fucking go, 'cause the other one's gonna be here.

The beard hurts by wrapping Sona's hands behind his back and binding them with a belt. There's a tall one, and there's Sonya's prisoner, and there's a bearded one behind him, pushing Sonya with a slice from time to time. On the top, the rain does not stop falling, and Sonia weeps with tears of tired powerlessness before fate.

The time for them ended in a sunny summer morning half a century ago. There were eleven of them, guerrillas for two months, but there were only two men killed in the woods and soldiers of the German punishment brigade who died in an exchange of fire. They were surrounded by a forest stream, where they parked, there were many Germans, and there were almost no bullets; eight of them fell at the scene of the battle, and three were taken captive by the wounded. The prisoners were hanged on the outskirts of a village unknown to them with signs on their chests and placed at their feet, after which they rotted two hot summer days until the Occupational Health Commission found it inappropriate to further intimidate the village population. They were then put on a cart and buried in a ditch dug up by villagers in the woods by the marshes.

The new power performed an operation with its thoroughness, with the only exception that the location chosen for burial was a lousy one. It's been a long time since there's a bad reputation for losing children there and living all kinds of swamps. Seven months later, a snowy February night, eleven guerrillas came out of the grave and saw the black sky over their heads again through the flying snow. The Germans were nowhere, they left in the fall, but the dead guerrillas couldn't believe it and believed that the enemy had established strong power and led the soldiers eastward. For propaganda purposes, fascists even allowed civilians to hang red banners, but all factories now worked in Germany, children taught German, and no one thought of resistance. Only eleven guerrillas heroically continued the war against the hated occupiers.

They found weapons in abandoned battlefields, they attacked truck fleets and stole fuel from which they then made bombs. They wandered through the forest, and no one could stop their continued bloody raid. Several times they were surrounded, but they came out of it because of their ability to turn into animals and because the bullets didn't take them. They did not know mercy for the traitors, judging them by their guerrilla court, which changed from case to case only the form of execution. Most often, they hung, but also drowned, strangled, quartered, cut their heads, broken their spines, ripped their skins, torn trees, boiled or roasted alive, and in some cases invented what was worse. It was rare to be shot with ammunition, although it has been easier recently. The prisoners were usually also tortured, in order to discover the places where the enemy was concentrated, the timing of the upcoming punitive operations, the political situation of the world fascism and the names of active supporters of the new order. In addition to destroying the people sold to the invaders, the guerrillas destroyed and destroyed everything they found in the way and considered to be of any importance to the enemy that is prosperous in the unreachable Germany. They blew up the train tracks, knocked off the train, crashed the power stations and destroyed the gas pipelines. They seized and destroyed long-range vehicles, and they even crashed the plane twice, and lost only two in their long journey. One, by the name of Shuk, died 30 years ago in a brutal battle with classified troops of fascist internal affairs after a hand grenade exploded under his feet. The second, former commander of the squad, who was called Ignat, by the name of Vushuhol, had disappeared for ten years in a flaming fire, and had thus far been considered simply missing by his comrades. Now the unit was led by Mitea, usually called Bear, because unlike his comrades, who were ordinary wolfs, he was particularly evil at turning into this big and dangerous beast.

The one who was ahead of Sonya that long summer morning of the last battle was very young, and he was barely 19 years old, and was called in the Mohnaty Party, even though his real name was Leonid. He didn't like it, and he preferred to destroy the enemy indiscriminately and indiscriminately, and he refused to admit that torture was a waste of time, and that he was sick and sleepy as a result of the screaming of pain. When he was alone, he killed the fascists at once, without reporting to the commander, for which he was repeatedly severely reprimanded, but could not punish him because every fighter was on the count. The other was called "Sova," because he never slept and liked to eat fried mice, and besides, Sova liked to strangle fascist children, especially boys, even though she wasn't much of a girl. On one occasion, he and Mohnato took the first-class walk in the woods, and he did not look at six children right in the field, while Mokhnaty was ripping off, like wet paper, dresses from two hanged young fascist teachers, to show the students the shame of their low betrayal and to explain to them who their real enemy was. The rest of the children, apart from one beautiful fascist girl who was brutally raped in the bushes and killed by the Mohnath, were released in the hope that a new guerrilla would grow out of one.

Sonia's been walking between the guerrillas for about half an hour, snorting to his own blood all the legs about the invisible bushes in the dark. What she hates most is that she never saw a scary talisman, and there's almost no hope of seeing him in the future. Turning her head at some point, she tried to talk to Sova, who seemed to understand more than her dark comrade, but received a sharp blow in the back, so she tripped and fell, and then Owl picked her up, grabbing her hair.

" I'll kill you, you bastard, " he reminded Sonia, a rock with yellow wolf fangs, and she never tried to talk again. Sonia doesn't doubt that she's going to be tortured a little bit by a guerrilla court, and after she's executed, she's only afraid that she's gonna have a bad form for the execution. Shooting, if not on the head, and even more so hanging, Sonia is not afraid, but the frowny faces of the guerrillas give out such a drive to inventiveness and innovation that she is not comfortable.

There's a lazy noise of the river coming out of the sandy rain, and there's a damp linen that doesn't have light on it. There are two more guerrillas sitting at the door and eating dried fish with hunting knives. One of them who sits on Sonya's left is called Pavel, or just the Bag, he's fat and ugly, his abdomen all the time snorting and groaning. Next to him, there's a knee-bound Kalashnikov machine on the ground, and the boots have already been destroyed, and there's grass sticking out of them. He's wearing a sports suit with a jacket that's obviously small. The bag is known among the guerrillas for its own lust, turned exclusively into animals with which he does not seek to have intercourse, since his genitals have long been banished and play for a long time, feeling the beast's love with their paws and kissing his swollen mouth until he is strangled or his neck is broken. The beasts, unaware of their fate, also love the Bag, and often you can see the squirrel, the hedgehog, or the fox running after it. The second, sitting on the right, the guerrilla is called Volody, and Repa is called probably for the strange shape of his head, which does not look like a head, but rather on the edge of the rusty bread with grains, so strongly distributed forward the forehead and chin on his freckles and pimples. There's a machine gun hanging behind Volody's back, and there's three grenades and an iron flask on his belt, and he's dressed like a civilian, only his boots are army, bricks.

- He's good. - He's harking at the sitters, he's getting on the doorstep and he's trying a piece of dried fish.

- You shouldn't have done that, Mokhnaty.

I told you to shoot her, and Owl wants to judge her.

It's not possible without a trial. What if she's not guilty? " And he smiles in the face of rare, stupid teeth like all idiots.

- Guilty, bitch. - Sleeping the Owl and taking Sonya's hair carefully, tearing loose belts on her hands. - Undress, fascist bastard, we're gonna torture you with matches.

- We're gonna put a wire in your ears, and Repa's happy.

" Why torture me," Sonia says. " I'm gonna tell you everything, I know where the Nazis have their bacterium stashes, and I can't speak German because I'm a high school doppelganger.

What kind of weapon?

" Fascists invented a new weapon, " Sonia patiently explains. Fascists put these guns in shells, and then the disease crawls out.

" You are an honest mother, " the Bag is washed away, and for a while there's a little vortex in his belly, and then he burps out loud.

- How the hell do you know all this?

We teach it at school to get used to the fascist way of warfare, and we as fascist children from childhood have been taught all these terrible diseases. If you want, I'll take you to the contagious warehouses, where the bacteria in the bathtubs are crawling.

" I don't believe her, " says Mokhnaty. " She lies everything.

" Yeah, it's a bad case, " says Owl.

" It's a trap, " the Mokhnaty. " It's clever, "even with some admiration for the fascist plan, he spits heavily into the ground.

- Why, why don't you believe me? - Sonia starts crying, her face swells, tears pouring out of her eyes, she rubs her fists and sighs.

The owl holds Sonya by its elbows while Repa removes her clothes, then they put her back on the raw soil, and when they put Sonya down with the weight of his body, the owl starts to burn her with matches. The fire flares up, flashes the animal-like faces of the guerrillas, snores and screams like a sliced slicer, pulls the belt out of his pants and beats the top of Sonya with a fucking stretch, aiming at the liver. Sonia is in a lot of pain, and she screams, trying to defend herself with her legs, and then the guerrillas rest and bite the fish with Sonya's belt on Mohnato, and the rain drops are baking about the match burns on her body. The animal is covered with blood bruises and carvings left by the fucking belt.

What do you say, fascist bastard? He's cracking his belt and Sonya's trying to cover her face with his hands, but he's squeezing her wrists tight.

Sonia often nods her head.

" I told you the truth, " she cries with tears. " I don't know anything else.

" Let's put wire in her ear, " Repa suggests.

You're telling me, it's back on Sonya Owlsa, but the guerrillas are pulling her iron hand at her chin and sticking her wire in her nose.

- Deeper, the Rep is racing.

Sonia screams into her voice, feeling the cold rain on her head and the blood that fills her throat, owl removes the wire and neatly like a dentist, turns Sonya's head sideways to poke in her ear. Sonya's nose is bleeding.

At this point, Tanya comes out of the woods, holding a small house with a hole in it instead of a door.

Tanya's story after she broke up with Sonia is simple, and when she saw the guerrillas, she ran off, and out of four shots of Mohnato, only one reached the target, hit her in the back between the shoulder and the shoulder. In the bush, Tanya dug a bullet with a sharp bitch and returned to the scene of the attack. By shoving her iron left hand like a claw into the trunk, Tanya climbed upstairs and ripped out the birdhouse along with the rusty nails from the wet lighted bark. The birdhouse was very old, and the tablets formed its roof and removed the nails from the walls. Despite curiosity and hunger, Tanya did not decide to open a birdhouse from which the remains of the old nest were stuck and stinked of the fall, but simply followed the Sonny trail. Watching her friend's flour from the bushes, Tanya was afraid that Sonya would die of wire in her ear and decided to leave. She believed that there really was a terrible mascot in the birdhouse, and if he was released, something terrible would happen that might help Sonya. So when Mokhnaty and Repa took her on the gun, Tanya just slammed the squatter about the stump she had on her feet, and he fell to pieces. But on Tanya's pond, she saw nothing but paws, some trash and pieces of broken nests, braided out of sticks, bird feathers, and animal hair.

The parties are surprised to see the girl with the iron hand smashed against the stumps of the squash, and through the curling drops, there's a squeezing of Sonia and a deaf groaning in the belly of the Bear. The owl rises hard from the tortured body of the girl, still holding a bloody piece of wire in his fingers. And that's when everyone feels a terrible smurf, like there's an elephant's decaying carcass all over the woods.

Sonia, lying on his back and therefore turned his eyes to the sky, is the first to see Him. He is one hundred feet tall, and the star on his wake-up call shines like a stone tower. Along his black horse's neck, standing on his knee in the night trees, the flames burn with long tongues. Sonia sees huge and blue bare feet that are put down into the strings and hundreds of human skulls that decorate the skull. Sonia sees a saddle made out of the skin of a murdered angel and a gymnast burned with lightning blows, and she sees him lift a sword of fire, burning a poppole.

No! " Sonia's screaming, but the blow of the split flame has already fallen through the dark crowns of trees on a wet shore, scrubbing everything in its path. The guns fall down, their tops fall, covered with crisp flames from the inexhaustible heat of the Red Army blade. A wave of fire blows up poor Tanya and carries her through the air like a light from a moth's candle. She doesn't even scream and disappears without a trace, all of a sudden disappearing like a piece of an empty fireworks missile.

Crazyly, the guerrillas flee, stripping their clothes off and turning into wolves. The only thing that doesn't run is a bag that's too fat to run away, but instead it's desperate to put a red-armey in the saddle from a vending machine. The guard has a long time to swing from behind his back, and the next blow of the fire sabbey, by stripping the flyer's head off, wipes off a part of the roof from the outside and passes low above the river, blowing the whirlwind of hot water. The ventriloquist flashes like a matchbox, the remaining piece of the roof crumbles inside and rises up from the river into a thick fog strip. The headless body of a fat guerrilla standing on a fire background, throwing its neck out with a blazing fountain of blood to meet the winds of rain, like a goose who has just been cut off from his head, scatters the last bullets in the sky, where no one can find them anymore, and it's only hard to fall back when the machine is already angryly throwing a tooth through the void.

The rest of the werewolves, looking, are carried along the river's bank, but the giant horseman, slow rode them, and they turn and throw themselves into the water. In the phantom fire of the burning ferment, it is already difficult to identify their half - beastly personality, diving under water in thirst to reach the other shore. A guard horse with a non-conical snoring is carefully walking into the water and, in the face of the whole body, a red Armenian hits the swords once on the water. The river boils with its slow motion, and the drowning wolf-wolfs seek deep, but die without reaching the desired coolness of the bottom-sil, from the boiling of boiling water. When the pairs fall apart, they see their baked-up baked corpses, all the way to the north.

While the massacre is under way, Sonya, sniffing her nose with blood, crawling on her back to the stump, kicking her feet in the wet ground. She doesn't know much about the pain in her stomach, and she's driven by the only desire to see a terrible mascot before she dies. But when the black statue of the horseman closes the black sky over it, Sonya stops crawling and quiet, without hystericality, crying for the impotence and in vain of his destiny, everything was for nothing from the very beginning. She was never able to defeat him.

He's staring from the height at the spread of Sonya, his dead face doesn't express feelings. Through the tears of Sonja, he sees his black-hand issina holding the reins, walking through a gymnast covered with charred holes from lightning strikes. Then Sonya hears his voice in his head, snoring and deaf, coming from all over, as if the earth itself was speaking.

I've been waiting for you for a long time.

Sonya's heart stops and the blood stops leaking into her throat and the cold air soaked in the water balance easily enters her chest.

Your body also bears the signs of fire, the prophecy is fulfilled.

The flame sword disappears in hell's blades, and the eyes of the demon look into Sonya's eyes, and in them it sees infinite calm, as in the winter sky filled with stars.

Now it's your turn, now you have to keep it.

In a few minutes, he's gone, as if he never existed. Sonia disappears into insensitive darkness, where dead birds sing at a very different level of bird voice.

It comes back when it's still night, rained out by rain, with bitter smoke in the dark, and the burnt trees are visible, and some of the trunks are still mysteriously smelting. When Sonia falls off the back of the ground, she dresses up, wrinkling herself with the pain of her clothes. She sees a place where a scary talisman flew out of a birdhouse, glowing in the grass like a rotten thing, but not in a hurry, something that she didn't know before. She thinks she may have been dead again, really dead, not since the brick was thrown into the head by the builders. She's really dead, like that long summer of a pioneer camp, when led Peter, with a blow from a black coastal cliff, opened her gates to hell.

Ah scary Peter, his curling dark hair and hands with long musical fingers, his undisturbed peek, his wrinkled voice, the faint smell of tobacco from a white shirt with a short wide sleeve, his laughing tanned friends, leading neighbouring troops. Sonia and her friend Dash drank dark-red Crimean wine with them, dragged on with little bites of bad grass, looked at pornographic images and gave to the lead in the shower darkness of the adult body, where the clock was ticking loudly, counting the time to the morning mountain. Drunk Dash was always taken to Igor's room, led by "The Sunrise, " while Sonya stayed with the others and allowed them to do everything, even what was not in the pictures. At the same time, the adults were rabies and tormented Sonya, no longer able to enjoy the human way, and Sonya thought it always happened in their scary world and patiently tolerated, even though she only liked Peter, whose kissing Sonya burned, like falling from a summer sky of stars. She liked it when Peter pressed her to the bed so that she could not move, ferociously and for a long time beat the whole body, kissing from time to time in the heat of the night on her forehead, and with the pain of Sonya felt the satanic force living in his undeveloped body, fell into a low-heaviness and flew low above the sky's meadows, almost touching the face of light-weight, flaming flowers.

And when the shift ended, Peter asked Sonya to sneak away from everyone to say good-bye to the seaside. It was a transparent sunny morning, they were walking barefoot on smooth sand, and Sonya knew that Peter would tell her something very important that might even change her whole life. When he leaned his back to the watered black cliff, Peter smoked for a long time, and Sonya collected shells to bring his mother home, and finally Peter told Sona to approach him. She came up looking like a breeze on her face, leaving the collected shells a pile of sand. He hugged her and held her to his chest, kissed her forehead, and then he grabbed her hair and hit her head in the duck with all his strength. He hit her again, but Sonya didn't remember this one when she fell after the first blow to the grass, burning eternal fire.

When she's dressed, Sonia washs her crying face in the icy river, then she goes back to the stabbing and lifts a terrible mascot out of the grass. It burns unbrokenly in her hand, shiny ruby metal surface and thin gold pattern, a Komsomol Sign Zoe of Kosmodemian.

A warm, shiny light enters Sonya, healing the pain that still exists inside her, she holds a badge to her lips.

" You love me, " says Sonya, who breathes into the gold profile.

The badges to the chest shirt, Sonya goes into a charred butt of rain that is no longer contained in the roof, falls on the shop and, closing her eyes before rain, thinks of Zoe, a dark-haired girl from Moscow's school number 217, hanged by fascists in the village of Petrocevo, who, on a guerrilla mission, hid her Komsomol badge in a squatter nailed on a young forest tree. Or maybe she didn't put him there at all, but the saddest young friend of mine, the frowning guerrillas. Or maybe this badge didn't belong to her at all, but appeared later in a museum, like the help of a saint scattered around the earth, because what a chammy hero without a badge. Or maybe Zoe himself wasn't hanged by being brutally tortured and raped, by the nameless fascists who spoke the animal language, and she just went missing on the front, like countless thousands of young Komsomolites like her. Or maybe she wasn't there at all, and only in the darkness of time did she exist, born of unveiling as a human fantasy, but from that it's no less beautiful, scary, and saintly. She wasn't even important, she was a perfect martyr, either she wasn't alive at all, or she died a long time ago, and her burning symbol, this ruby-golden badge, filled with her blood, now condemned to burn forever, regardless of the truth that went back to the past, whether it was real or not.

At dawn, Sonia fell asleep, becoming completely invisible in a burning house, walking in her sleep on glittering golden dew fields of night, whispering with Zoe's barefoot, on which a dark trail of noose was seen in her neck.

Mashi's second face

And many of the nations, and the tribes, and the tongues, and the tribes, will look at their corpses for three days in half, and will not let their bodies be put into their graves...

After three days, the spirit of life from God entered into them half-heartedly, and they both stood on their feet, and a great fear came upon those who looked at them.

Opening 11.9, 11.11

It's waking up in the coming evening twilight, and it's stopped raining, but the sky that clenched its mouth to the pressure of the cold wind is still sad and pasmurous. Pretty far from the rock stump, Sonya finds a gland replacing Tanya's hand, which still contains a piece of burnt wire with splashes of her flesh on it that look like black melted cheese. Smileing that Tane is now returned to her real hand for a pioneer salutation in the stone forest, Sonia throws the iron off the coast into close lead water. Then she goes against the current for a long time, but doesn't find the bridge she needs to go to the other side and go east, where there's a tree in the field and there's a rusty tractor underneath it.

It is already dark when Sonya enters a boat station, fenced by a wire fence, where the stacks of non-floating boats that are turned upside down, and where the savage dogs live together with the former watchman of the Greegoria boat station, long fired from a shortage of salary money but continue to exist on the site of the station for lack of any alternative. At first, the greedy masters hired another watchman for half the price, and Grigory fought the alien at night, punching empty fuel jerricans and groaning like a large underwater bird. The alien was very young and feared the war published by Gregory, but he did not leave, but only drank vodka, locked up in the watch and brought down the dogs. He wasn't driven away by fear, but by need, because he had no money to pay. The station was locked into a castle, and Gregory began to live in it in peace, albeit without pay, by fishing in the river and climbing the nearby villages for bread. His clothes almost dried up, his body dried up, his eyes fell down, and Grigorius took on such a look that a man from the Monk Shatun took him for a new mover and lived with him for a while in a guard, listening to Gregory's throats and loyally feeding the teacher with pies with peas. But with the cold, the monks did not bear the hardships of the station's existence and disappeared, leaving a dirty sock and a thin book with the commandments of unknown holys under the shop.

By the day Sonia knocked on the station gate, Grigory had eaten nothing for a week and no more food was needed. He didn't need to move, sitting in the dark space of the station on the rugged chair, waiting for death to come. Grigory's death was seen as a normal continuation of life, but where no food or drink is needed any more, he is free to stand up and walk on windy autumn roads far away, to walk around the light. For a long walk, Gregory had prepared a stick for himself, because his feet might not have gone, and he now listened carefully to what was happening, without trusting the weakened eyesight, to immediately determine the occurrence of death and not to suffer any more stupid expectation.

Seeing Sonya, Gregory immediately realizes that it was the holy girl, Praskovya Falczykov, who walks around and exposes herself to scavengers, trying to shame them with her purity. She was born out of the earth and her father, God, who appears to Gregory to be a great ashamed man with an unwashed beard, knotted feet, and a bottomless look of large clear eyes. Gregory knows that God drinks vodka by eating it full of cabbage and bread, and he eats nothing else by his natural simplicity. When people do things like that, God is ashamed and sighs, carefully thinking with a big rag on his head how to fix things.

Gregory rejoices in Sonia's arrival and decides not to let her into the station to be ashamed of his hermitic filth. The girl must have been hungry and trembled, her skin so thin that she could see the blood vessels. In the weak hope that a pathetic man will let himself warm up and give some food, she knocks with an indeterminate fist at the rusty gate. Gregory looks at her through the window, deeply ashamed, and the purity of Paraskeva, abandoned by his father in an inhuman cold world, makes him feel awful for his quiet prayer muttering.

Without getting through, Sonia goes away, Grigory hears her little bare feet touch the ground, the blessed God's shame fills Gregory with tears from his eyes. At the same moment, the watchman's door opens and goes into Sonja, sneaking her legs on the doorstep, closing the door, she sits on a shop opposite Grigoria with her hands frozen on her knees. The Watchman is baptized, wondering at the holy force that prevents him from remaining in a small state of shame.

" Do you have any boats, Uncle? " asks Sonya, looking at his hands, and Grigory does not answer her, sneaking out Sonia's face and looking for signs of cattle swearing. In the blonde hair of Sonia, the ground is stuck, on the nostril of the scratch, the coat is stained with rotten grass and sand, all of which rechristen Grigorius.

" I have to go to that shore, " says Sonya.

Gregory is racing and getting baptized again because he knows there's gonna be more torture on that beach and then she's gonna get killed. There is an abandoned church on a forest hill, inaccessible to heavy November fogs, from which the devil's atrocities reign over lifeless fields. If it hadn't been for a river coming from a saint's subterranean bath, it would have been a long time before Grigoriya had eaten, without squeezing with the hardness of the bones of the old meat. The two villages on the upstream side of the river were completely devastated. Gregory has seen many fires burning near the church and heard Satan's mysterious singing, and one day he saw a woman in a black sandwich bathing in the icy river of her strangely silent baby.

Sonia lifts her clean eyes to Grigoria, full of unearthly sorrow.

The boatman rises up and walks to the door, making his tears clear from his many days of malnutrition, and the naive sacrifice of God's daughter takes away his strength. He realizes that even pity is inappropriate in the execution of God's predestined work. Touching the old boat into the water, Grigory prays, confesses to the cat-eyed heavenly man, who has completely snorted him, and decides to go looking for salvation in the distant monasteries without waiting for his death.

Once and for all, Grigory takes Sonya to be tortured, she sits quietly, still folding her hands on her knees, and stares into the water. If she even smiles childishly, why does Grigory want to turn back, but by pulling her teeth, she does not yield to weakness and continues her heavy Judino cause by listening to the breath of a girl who is meant to suffer terrible torment.

When the boat's nose hits the sand, Grigory stands still, staring into a cold, ruthless space, and the Sonya goes from the boat to the deformed grass.

" God help you, girl, "by getting baptized and losing substantial tears says Grigory.

" Thank you, " answers Sonja and irons the old man with his hand on the shoulder, fearing that the forces would leave him at all, Gregory would leave in the rain. With his jaw groaning out of grief, he crumbles to the middle of the river, where he lets loose the yarn and looks back, and the sun is no longer on the shore, and the place where her feet have stepped seems empty and scary. Then Grigory starts to wipe out by covering his face with his hands and noticing that his old boat is already full of water flowing through a hole under a can of water that keeps coming.

Sonia is walking along the path among the huge black trees. There are no stars in the sky. Sonia is hungry, and when she sees a small window light behind the branches, she pulls off the path, hoping to find something to eat outside the human home. As she climbs out of the bushes of a brown-red thorn, she sees a stone church on a plaque surrounded by crosses of Orthodox graves, in a dove's window where the light she has seen warms. The church smells like raw stone and foliage, with its feet in the steps, and with two hands, Sonia pulls off the heavy door and makes a dangerous entry into the wet darkness. There, in the vast tomb darkness, there is an alexandritic fire circle that flows Satan's blood to two God-forsaken villages, the Small and the Big Horochoves.

It started a few years ago, when an old Pelagei from Little Horochovka, in a violent birth, was left by her lustful niece Milka, who even in a villageless maniac was poking her stomach in the fields. Milka choked and puked before she died, crying in pain, but all she had was blood, and the child never came out. When the slut was quiet forever, Pelagueya, with a snout, opened up her swelling belly, as she had once dislodged pigs in the fall, and pulled out a freak so scary and big that the old woman immediately stopped wondering about Milky's death. The freak was alive and hairy, but he couldn't even scream out of his uglyness, but he was snoring, bleeding, and groaning in the hands of the midwife. Pelageya, however, felt sorry for her, christened Mary and gave her to a village fool, Matreune, who was hiding in Pelaguea's home from psychiatric doctors, and was foolishly present with milk, which was usually handed over to Pelagueen's old man Trofim every morning for therapeutic drinks. Under Pelaguea's loving looks, Mary sniffed the mother-in-law over her chest and slowly but continuously grew up.

Soon, on the Big Horochovka, which was actually more than half the Little One, there was a rumor about a scary freak crawling down the ceiling at Pelagea's house and raising the dead from the coffins. In the dungeons, it was said that the cabbage would now be born from the devil, that the village church had blackened its cheeks to the kissing icon of God's mother, and that in the past two years three old women and two grandfathers had died in the Great Horochovka and no one had died in the village church. Both villages were inhabited by old men, all young people were scattered throughout the cities, and peas occupied the front trench in the line of human defence from death. On the third spring, Grandpa Pancrates went to Little Horochovka to ask for a freak to live in the Great, and from Small to use it as needed. Pancrates were struck by motherly swearing, and a strong braid began to be built around the Little One.

However, they could not simply accept the eternal domination of their village of mortal horror, and the dark night of March, Pancrates, drunk with vodka and a throat of frontal songs, broke a braid on a collapsing comb, and a crowd of starving and unweaked older older women, armed with axes, knives and whips, ran into a breach. However, because of the oppression of the old insomnia, the small people were always ready to defend themselves, and in the dark night, in secret from State authority, there was a bloodbath set on fire by two burned aggressors and accompanied by a grumpy old curse. Pelageya fought with a poker who smashed the enemy's old women's heads with her mother and threw their brains into the ground, without spared her own cue, Tamara Lukin, who even had a stream from her mouth after Pelagei's blow, as if it had fallen out of a bucket. The Pancrates, who were squeezing with an axe in their backyards in sleeping shirts and dumb old women, were about to move to Pelageya, but Trofim discharged a double-barrel with an axe, and the car with a dead driver crashed into the barn, killing all six chickens in Pelage. After that, in the absence of ammo, Trofim was able to fit his butt, but he received an axe in the ridge and fell, rubbing and spitting blood at his doorstep, on the corpse with a fresh blow of butt into the teeth of the older old lady Condratyevna. Pelagia was nailed withforks to the wall of a broken barn and gave her soul to Satan in crust, when a hand-in-hand, led by a second small-scale grandfather, Ivan Fedotovich, arrived, and the Greaters retreated, throwing the battle tools and fatally injured the enemy.

There are twelve dead bodies left on the battlefield, not including smoking. But their death was not in vain, because upon the death of the greedy Pelagea, there was agreement, and Masha was settled in the premises of a neutral peasy church, and it turned out that she did not crawl over the ceiling and did not revive the dead, but, by sucking her index finger, returned the young power. After the beating, there were only two men left in both villages: Ivan Fedotovich of Maloy and Neil Gavrilych of the Great, and now each of them has made ten old wives, completely despiseing the previous Christian custom. Godly old women were baptized, but they fell into sin, and soon they reached the full extent of the cattle, which was greatly contributed to by old - age senileism and the general fall into childhood. In the warm summer days, right on the village streets, you could see the skinny, naked old women, the worm of a bunch of people who had a gang relationship right on barren ground, or who were dancing with a swirling choir under the screaming of indecent frequencies around the well, or even with the laugh of shaking, chatting chicken legs on a braid, each with a shrivelled broom between the shrivelled frogs.

A year later, the old women began to have children, crooked and shrivelled, as if they were old enough to hope for the rebirth of the extinct villages. Masha had by then turned into a humpback pale girl with a puffed-up lower lip, living right in a church, a puddle in the corners, and she's gonna rip off some kind of burning, strange stench. With the help of her dungeon, Masha has constantly damaged icons, pointing her eyes on their faces and greased their lips. On the holidays, the Gospel was read backwards in the church, spit in the crucifix, and climbed on the altar in turn, pissing on the sacred book. Mary was leading the orgy, screaming out a grumpy voice of swearing, and at the end she always defecated, rubbing off on the revealed Bible, and then the sin began immediately.

When Sonja shows up on the doorstep of the church, there's an evening prayer that Neil Gavrilych is long reading, pulling his pants down to his knees and replacing all the words in prayer with obscenities. Over the altar, swinging and turning around its axis, hanging Mary's cat, dripping liquid cat shit. There's an old lady standing around with candles in mourning dresses and handkerchiefs, baptizing their skinny asses and mimicing intestinal ventilation with rhymes. When they hear the squeak of door hooks, they turn to Sona. Their dry, built-in faces seem to be exactly the same to Sona, as if Masha had created his own people in the Horokhovkas.

Neil Gavrilych stops blaspheming and sends a hairy moat to the door, stares at Sonya with a sting, and roars down. As a sign of this, the old lady sneaks around and starts crawling into Sonya with her five-point crucifixion with her candle-free hands, but Sonya's looking not at them, but behind the altar where Mary stands. The eyes of a small hump are glittering like black egg yolks, mixed dirty braids hanging on both sides of their faces, keeping their teeth compressed, smashing their lips and making quiet whistles. Sonya feels like a mascot with an icy pain stabbing her in the chest like he's trying to hide behind a thin Sonya skin, and the pain of Sonya opens her mouth and curls her fists. Through tears, she sees from the back wall of the church a giant man with a goat's head dressed in a black coat. His eyes are exactly the same as Mary's, chaining Sonya's legs to the floor.

Father, Mary snores, let me kill her, Father, or you love her more than I do.

Sonia can't move or scream, she only feels the frosting eye of a goat head and the pain in the chest that the talisman entered.

Let me kill her, Father.

Old women throw themselves at Sonya, grab her and drag her like a doll to a two-brown cross standing on the wall. They strip Sonya with their sharp yellow fingernails and tie her head down by the legs on the cross. Neil Gavrilych clamored to God to cover him with a selection of nauseous curses. Crazy money crawls out of every corner, pins the girl's body and shoves her fingers in the eyes, and one of them, Ulyana Ignatievna, pokes in Sona's belly with a shoe-shyle. Neil Gavrilych is on his way to the scene to rape Sonya while she's still alive, but the hump grabs him by the edge of the shirt and he cries with his hands in the air. At last, the old woman becomes so many that they lift the cross with the ropes of Sonia's chained to him and fasten him on the wall.

There are traces of burns and bruises on Sonya's body in the sun. The freak's holding his palm to Sonny's abdomen.

I will kill you and my power will be greater, there will be no need to share power, soon my power will be everywhere, my father will give you to me.

Masha extends his hand in the direction of space, and from the darkness, she falls into it, and she squeezes a fist and puts a cold bark into the chest of Sonina in front of the heart.

Go away, she says, and presses the whole body.

Masha takes out the sheath, after which from the hole in Sonina's chest, the flow of blood begins to flow, and turns to the flock.

" We will be associated with her, " she says. " Just let blood flow on the floor of the temple.

In return, she is given a sclerotic vogue, and in the midst of the amazingly open eyes, the crucifixed and bleeding Sonya begins the earth wedding.

Wasil's traveler is making his morning rounds, and he's already drunk because of the painful need of daily drowsiness. Vasily is indistinguishable, trying to lighten up the monotonous boredom of his path, covered with the cold autumn rain. At times, he sounds deaf and hits the rail with an iron stick, listening to the sound reflected in the indistinct field. Vasily's working life would have been like a donkey's journey behind his caravan if it hadn't been for a sip that he was constantly pouring down his throat. From the drink of Vasilia, everything is done to one place, and he forgets his missing man in the mirror room was given a caravan.

With Vasily's moaning, she lifts her eyes from the splash and sees a naked, dirty young woman walking along the railway track with a blood stain on her face. Vasili doesn't care who beat and raped the woman, he's just looking at her stabbing legs. He knows he's gonna have to testify to the gray police now, but he doesn't care about that either. In her hand, she holds a stick with two nails at the end, a woman walking past Vasily and he decides to wait a little while before turning around and looking at her naked ass. And then a stick with two nails hits him in the back of the head.

Vasily falls on the embankment and crawls down the rash gravel, and the woman accelerates his creeping foot, then removes Vasily from the bushes and wears it on herself. She pulls an almost empty bottle of wine out of her orange jacket pocket and drinks the rest, then she picks up Vasily's iron stick and goes back to the embankment. When she looks far away, she wipes her hand wet with rain, and then she smiles because she finally remembers her name, and her name is Natasha. Vasilia's corpse is starting her new blood trail.

At 9 a.m., Natasha opens the door of a pensioner, Nadia Philipovna, who runs a household in the apartment of her married son, Roman. The rain has already washed the blood out of Natasha's face, and she threw the iron stick into the bushes. Philipovna's hope, wrinkling from Natasha's stench, which she explains to the girl's simple origins, still brings her water in a cup, leaning out of the door, using what Natasha really punches her in the face. The pensioner falls and Natasha pushes her with her leg, clearly enjoying the power returning to her. She takes the corpse to the apartment, picks out her clothes and shoes from the daughter-in-law's wardrobe, pours out half a bottle of perfume, washs her hands and her head in the bathtub, eats alive a slutty parrot caught in a cage, doesn't even spit out her prunes, and geeks her dead lips found in a box by the mirror with lipstick. Then she puts her eyes in, puts the pudding on the swollen holes on the sides of her nose, binds her hair with a pinch, and rubs her fingernails with a brush, popping it into a bottle of pink varnish. When she leaves the apartment, the only difference between a common young and handsome woman and her is a kitchen axe hidden in the sleeve for the cuttery of the bones.

About half of Natasha 11 kills an axe on the head in the front of a nine - story house of a sixth - grade student, Volodyu, who with his friend Igor is skipping school. Igor tries to escape, but Natasha gets him on the stairs, grabs him by the neck, and hits him in the head with an axe, and the boy's legs lose their steps, and he hangs in Natasha's hand. She smashes both schoolboys' faces against the front wall and, holding them by the hair, melts the blood and brains with thick stripes of white plaster. At the same time, she represents Sonya's boys and her little friends.

Half an hour later, Natasha attacks Leed's schoolgirl, who comes home after a short school day, only because she has the same color hair as Sonya's, drags her into the back, suffocates her, and bites her throat, drinks her hot baby blood running to Leeda by the door of her jackets, holding a corpse by the whiskey, so the girl's shoes stick to her knees. Then, putting Leed's cheek on the parapet, Natasha and her mat chopped off her head with an axe, so that Leed wouldn't stand up and walk again.

Around noon, Natasha, in the back, kills an axe on a middle-aged woman's head to take her wallet with money. With this money, she buys a real meat axe at the hardware store and throws the old one into the sewers.

Then Natasha walks around the city like a mad wolf, smashing the heads of middle school children with an axe and blazing them with the bright blood of the walls of the houses. She senses that the police are already squeezing a deadly ring around her, sometimes she hears a bark of battle dogs in the next street and a shaky cliché voy of sirens. For about four hours, she's being detained, and she's running towards a police car, squeezing an ax in her hand, two militiamen, breaking up, screaming to meet her, ordering her to stop. Gunshots stab her in the chest, pouring blood on her white blouse under a split double, and Natasha screams at one of the militiamen with an axe and hits the shoulder. The second one continues to shoot at her from behind, one bullet hits Natasha in the head, and despite the pain, it kills the wounded enemy who fell on the asphalt and picks up the gun. The second police officer runs to the car, sneaking into a shot-out double and hiding in his pocket the finally produced remote-action weapon, Natasha leaves the dead dark streets. The circle of her bloody trajectory closes, returning to the chemical bastion in the fields. In the dark, she comes up to the pit, where she comes out at the pale autumn dawn, and when she stops at the ground surface of the bus, and throws her head in with her mouth open, she drinks cold rain.

It is at this moment that Sonya begins to see again with his wide-eyed eyes. It's a Komsomol badge planted on a young guerrilla's blazing chest and now part of Sonya's soul, protecting the girl's heart from a fatal stabbing. The cross on which she was crucified was already lying on the floor in the middle of a black church, and satanic old women were snatching around, preparing to cook and eat Sonya. At the altar, there's a humpbacked Masha, with his bare hands, burning a bunch of raw wood, squeezed with pain, and Sonja rips his hands off crunchy nails and rises from the cross. The cannibals humming from it, surrounding the humpback Masha and the rat's rope, and the snooze lifts its head up to the church dome and sees the sky that is painted there, and the sun burning with its long tongues in the middle of it. Sonia smiles again, finding the thread of her eternity and slowly rising into the air.

Ah, what freedom is filled with the measured beating heart of Sonya, when her feet are torn away from the ground, seeking to draw clouds, and her eyes slowly swam past columns, just to be credible as the church dome supports the church dome... What darkness flows in her blood, full of star dust and cold endless spaces that can't warm up any sun...

Sonia looks down at the height of three meters and meets the evil eyes of the little humpbunya, and the old flocks of skinny black birds shrug around their mistress with dry lips, poking the curses. Sonia takes a fire wheel from the sky with both hands, and throws it into Mary's head. Like a moored kikimore, it's like a moist death scream, a fun echo, one after the other, falling to the floor, turning into an elongated curly bonfire, reminiscent of Sonia's last pioneer summer.

Mary alone remains unharmed when the fire wheel hits, the flame only burns her bosoms, and she keeps looking at Sonya by covering her face with her palm. Her eyes, however, lost power over the resurgent Sonia body, whose chest is glowing with ruby metal. When she realizes this, the clot of invisible gravity passes by the sneaking out of Sonya's air with a stinking wind and hits the church wall, causing cracks on the surface of the frescoes. The next blow goes into the dark a little higher than Sonina's head, and Sonia barely hides behind the nearest column and then throws the second fire wheel into Mary. Gorbunya doesn't even try to avoid a collision with him, the dress excites and splits with charred holes, opening fireless skin. Two blows of a giant hammer shakes a column that hangs in Sonya's air, and the dome is filled with lime, stuck in her hair. When she sees a crack in the body of the column, Sonya flies behind another wheel in flight, throwing a third wheel, and she sees the fire rolling around Mary like weightless water, burning the rubber bands that bind her bosoms. And she sees in Masha's naked hump her second face, small and evil, she sees little legs and pens sticking back from her back. She sees a Siamese Brother who, feeding on his sister's diabolical life force, grows slowly like trees.

The next side wave hits Sonino's shoulder and throws it back, spinning the body around the axis in the air. Without spending any more energy on the fire, Sonya is flying down an arc that falls down the aisle near which Mary is standing. When she unearthed Sonya's plan, the little humper keeps on facing her, opening up and closing her mouth like a toad. The church shakes from the collision of the walls, one of the columns with a groaning collapses, and a piece of the wall falls behind it, lifting up the dust pole and opening a huge broken window into the stormy night.

When she hits the top, Sonia kicks Mary's knees into her mouth and slams the girl's body down to the floor and slaps her teeth in her chin and rips her little baby face on her back with her hands. Masha's hump is bleeding out, snoring and beating in agony, trying to remove death from the air by his hands by the hair. But Sonia's agitatingly rips the little mouth, breaks the jaws, and rips the baby's breath.

When Mary stops twitching, pulls out her dirty bare feet to the fire, Sonia squeezes her teeth and sits next to her on her knees, she breathes hard, her hands are in the blood.

" There's no reason to share power, " she says out loud, wrinkling at the pain of the gums, even though no one can hear it anymore.

Found on the floor with a knife, Sonja slits Mary's throat and grabs two hands by her whiskey, breaks his head and removes it from the blood-stained neck. Then she chops off her right brush, hurls her blood on the floor, and frys the brush over the fire on the knife blade. After swallowing the bad taste of burnt meat, Sonya dresses up and, dragging his head across the floor by the side of the car, leaves the battlefield. Under the rainy twilight sky, she sees a goat on her knee in dark river water, whose eyes are closed.

Sonia throws his head under his feet, into aluminum water, which immediately pours a dead, scalded face, drowning his head, dragging deep into his long, split hair. The raining cycles quickly fade, turning around, and Sonia walks between the tomb crosses and the woods.

Partyans

The fourth angel poured out his cup in the sun, and he was given to burn people with fire.

Opening 16.8

The darkness of the night is already filling the main building, approaching the entrance, Natasha looks back at the place where she fell, hit by poisonous nails in the face, and finds a trail of blood stain on the sand. The black windows of a black shop with dusty glasses are melting over her head, signs of another, unreal time where she now exists, are the dead afraid, she asks herself. Do the dead feel hopeless rings on their bodies, because I am now dead, and the sky is opened above me, and there is no heaven or hell, except the endless sorrow of death? The death is simple and not scary, consisting only of a stream of blood and a crunch of broken cartilage. Death is normal, like sex, which also scares you when you're a kid until you grow up, and it doesn't make sense that what you're afraid of is being done by everyone.

Natasha walks into the shop, she goes up to the second floor and sits on the iron floor by the remains of the fire, and she thinks the smell of Sonia is still visible under the walls of the high-end structures. Natasha walks his hand through the cool ash of the fire and listens to it squeaking down the carnivals.

Kostik and Luba come back from the hunt for the night, and with the fatigue of only the dead, they curl up the building by dragging behind the feet of a dead stray dog, and Natasha hears their footsteps. She pulls a gun out of her pocket, the kids go under her and start climbing up the stairs, suddenly Luba stops, smelling Natasha. When he doesn't see her yet, Kostik slowly puts a loaded self-gun in the dark, and Natasha shoots him in the head, pushing the dog loudly into the void of a gun. After the first two shots, Kostik falls on the steps, the next bullet hits the railer with a bell, but then two more hits the target. Lyuba pulls Kostika out of the area of the shooting, and Natasha, by hiding the gun in his pocket and picking up the axe, jumps straight down, kicking his feet on the iron floor. Lyuba throws iron at her and hits her leg, Natasha straightens out after jumping and throws himself forward with a fierce war. The girl picks up a self-gun with a short click and releases a poisoned nail into her abdomen with a terrible blow to Natasha's axe and breaks her shoulder and knocks her off her feet. With his knees on the boy's chest, his head is cut off by three blows of an axe, with a shudder of his hand covering his face. Then she pulls out a nail stuck in her stomach, grabs Lub by the hair and drags her upstairs. Luba squeals with one hand that still listens to her, clings to the railing, pulls her victim upstairs, and Natasha throws her on the floor with force.

" Where did the girl with the white hair go? " she asks.

" The bastard, " curved by wild pain in a cut shoulder, answers Luba.

" I'll kill you, bitch, " says Natasha calmly.

Lyuba doesn't talk, Natasha swings and hits her with an axe on the tibia, smashing the bone, the skinny figure of Luba screams on the floor.

" Don't beat them, they went into the woods, " she screams with a voice of horror. " This one by the river.

- Why?

"I don't know, "Luba's leg is beginning to rip out the insufferable pain and words in her mouth, "Natasha again grabs her hair and lifts her up from the floor, "Luba closes her face with her hand, "and the hatchet axe beats her neck. After the second blow, the girl's body falls on the floor, hurls into the wall with a dark stream of blood, and Natasha brings her head up to her face, looking into her dead eyes, and then throws it over the wall with a swing.

" Look, you damned little brat, " she says, turning to the missing Sona and wiping the blade of an ax about the clothes on the corpse of the beheaded girl. " That's how I'm gonna kill you.

When Natasha goes to the wet field, she hears from behind the woods the blows of distant thunder, but looking around, she can't see the buttocks because it's not really thunder, it's actually the echo of the titanic fight of Sonia with the mash's hump breaking the stone walls of the fucking church. In the dark forest, Natasha thinks of the cold enchanting power of the stars that have come down from the sky to the ground, and of his fate, which is losing direction in the interlocking of water-dropping trees. She's on the path and she's taking Sonin back because it's the only path north. She finds a tree on which a terrible talisman lived in a birdhouse and touches the wounds left on his bark by the iron Tanina hand. It's coming out into a fresh, rough run by a half-burned burrow and exploring a charred house without a roof standing by the river.

The shop where Sonya slept is full of her tender scent, and Natasha, sitting on the scuttles, squeezing her mouth to a human-friendly board to imagine Sonya right next to her and to see her clear eyes. And then she gets scared because all of a sudden she realizes the rash and that Sonya didn't destroy her like the others, but left her to rot. Natasha can't explain the reasons for this, but she realizes that Sonya did it on purpose.

"Why didn't you kill me?" she whispers to the shop, and the tears suddenly begin to flow out of her eyes. On the outside of her hand, she tries to wipe her tears, but they flow more and more, and they can't be stopped anymore, like Natasha's dark life's ice has melted and it's his melted water.

There's a short and deaf burst of automatic fire on that shore, like a large wild boar running through a bush.

Natasha's sobbing and she's twitching with her whole body, she's breathing hard, she's feeling like she can't live in the cold autumn, and she thinks the past life is a long dream. She recalls the court of the building school, where she smoked with her friends, looking at the semi-translucent wall behind the stone fence of the poplars, and the girl's mother's conversation. She remembers the violent events in a dark, vomiting dormitory room, clinging her fingernails to the edge of a washed sheet, and the sad whirlwind of her student orgasm, and the blows of the snorting bodies to the squeaking bed. She remembers the time of the autumn rains, filled with drunken drinking and dancing in twilight corridors, but she cannot remember what she felt then, and therefore the memory does not comfort, but only deepens Natasha's grief into a dead past.

She cries for a long time until the tears in her eyes are over, and then she rises up to follow Sonya's trail to the end of the earth. She goes down to the shore, where the rain-dropping dry cane grows in the water. But even this almost stillborn sound is enough to make a gray mustache guerrilla called Opper smell the presence of a stranger nearby.

The rest of the squad came here by the marks left on the branches by the comrades, missing late to the assembly site for 24 hours, and the bear knew they would never return. Only death could force his invincible warriors to disobey orders. By carrying on an indescribably bloody revenge, the bear, with the horror that had first woken in years of war, thought that the final battle was coming.

The oatmeal attacks Natasha from behind, separated from the log wall, and his heavy, wet and stinky body knocks her down with her stomach on the grass. By pressing a woman's hand to the ground, the stabbing axe, the Opper presses his victim's knife against the rib and orders her to not move. However, Natasha, with unexpected force, turns under him on his side and sillylyly shoots Uparu's gun into his abdomen, in response to which a wide army knife smacks Natasha's side. Despite the pain, she slaps the enemy with her elbow into the hole and, by freeing her arm with an axe, crawls aside to have space for the swing. The oatmeal grabs her by her leg and falls back on top with a crunch, twisting Natasha's hand holding the axe. Natasha's trying to shoot again, but the ammo's over, and the gun pointed at the guerrilla in the beast's eyes only clicks powerlessly.

The tree trunk is silently causing the Bear &apos; s heavy carcass to grow on the lower part of its face with a long beard. He's got this weird squeezing, and the Oppy's pissed off, crawling away, leaving Natasha lying on the spot of the fight, and she's standing on the fours holding her side apart. The bear looks at blood stains covering Nashina's blouse where the police bullets entered her body. His paid gymnast is dark from the water, because the squad just crossed the river to swim.

" What's his name? " he asks deafly, and the face of him with his hair, like he's pulling out forward, and he's no longer like a bear, but like a giant monkey.

" Natasha, " says Natasha, who is more comfortable catching an axe and preparing for the battle of death.

- Who shot you?

- Legged.

- For what?

- She killed a lot of people, so they shot him.

- How much?

- I didn't.

- Why did you kill me?

- Because I hate you.

" So you're not a guerrilla, " rejoiced with the Opper holding on to Natasha's stomach shot.

" You're gonna stab me, " Natasha answers by climbing up from the ground. " If you had a bullet in your gun, you'd blow your brains out.

There are two other guerrillas on the beach, one of them one-eyed, by the name of Rat, and the other, a dark-haired woman in a mud-wrinkled braid called Alena by the nickname of Oppa. A rat carries a handgun on his back for a particularly fierce battle, an automatic machine gun on Ospa's chest, and three grenades on his belt. They are rarely separated, though they did not bear each other in life, but death brought them love that requires neither kisses nor any other sexual affection.

" Ours are missing here, " says the Bear.

" Didn't you hear, " Natasha replied. " Or did they shoot on that bank?

" I shot, " says Oppa.

"I told you, there was nothing to eat, "the rat laughs like a rotten tooth.

" I've got the eyes of the wolf, " says Oppa. " A real fascist girl, a blonde girl, and her face is German. It turns out she wasn't really there.

" I know this girl," Natasha interrupts her. " She's not just a girl, she's a scary bastard, a real fascist bastard, I want to kill her myself.

You've got to judge the bitch.

" Where did she go, which way did she go? " Natasha turns to Osp, wrinkling with pain in the side.

There, smallpox waves its hand to the north.

" She needs to be caught up with, " Natasha's evil decision.

" Wait for the earth to sink, " says the bear.

" The lovely one here was a battle, " says Oppa.

- Tanks, the rat's roaring.

"Stop the rubbish," the bear boils on him. "The tanks would go to the woods. That's, you know, the new German cars without wings, which hang like clouds in the air.

" Helicopters, " says Oppa, once tested by a Hitler boy, have a word. Osp had to cut off that boy's four fingers before he gave up a military secret, and she was very proud of her patience.

- Oh, you fucking bastard, he's fighting in the dark sky of the rat.

" Maybe someone left, " says the Bear. " Maybe the Owl.

His hard red hair is like a camel's hair, and he's small, and his vertebra's crooked.

" There were traces of wolf in the sand by the water, " he says.

The bear pulls off the head of a fallen earshot, the party is silent, somewhere far away is hearing the noise of a passing train.

" Do you have guns for your gun? " violates Natasha's silence by examining the blood palms.

When the guerrillas scoured the territory, they found the remains of clothing and a dark place on the ground where the Bag had fallen, the blood of which had been left on the wall from a stain that had been drawn down, and they gathered around it in a circle.

" Comrades of the fighters, " turns to the guerrillas of the Bear, looking at their harsh, inhuman faces. - We swear before our heroly dead comrades to the last drop of blood to fight the fucking fascism, as they did. - He turns to Natasha. This girl, whose chest was met by enemy bullets instead of love, we'll take her to our unit, and she'll take the place of the fighters who fell for the freedom of the motherland.

" Thank you, " says Natasha.

" Tomorrow you'll become a cocktail, " the bear decides.

Sonia went down into the ravine, fell on her wounded leg, smallpox was far from her and shot her in the legs, trying to deprive the victim of the ability to move. Only one bullet hit the target, but that would be enough without making Sonia as transparent as the cold air of the night. Sonia could only disappear in total immobility, and while Oppa was looking at the blood trail on the grass, standing just two steps from Sonya, sitting under a tree on fallen leaves, she had to endure disgusting pain and clamp the wound on the tibia's palm. The party studied the area for a long time and silently, poking the blood with its finger and driving the machine through branches of trees. When she finally left with her moths and her boots in the foliage, Sonia let the blood flow safely to the ground, shutting her eyes out of pain. She didn't know how many more guerrillas were moving in the night forest and felt tired and unhappy. She thought about what it would have been like if she'd been hit by one of Mary's blows and the golden enamel stars would have stopped in her eyes forever.

" You probably don't care who keeps you, " she whispered to the mascot that warms her child's heart under your skin. " You're as cruel as everyone else, you don't know how to love me.

The hardest thing for Sonya is that it can't rise above the tops of the trees and fly north without distorting its path because of their well-inflicted trunks. Whether the weather is bad or whether Sonia has been stretched to the limit by removing fire wheels, however, she has to walk despite her lame leg and the need to get away from the enemy's journey as quickly as possible. In fact, Sonja is suffering for nothing because he does not know the history of the guerrilla movement in the province, or else he would be calm, because the guerrillas are left with only five and are moving in the opposite direction, in vain, to find in the backs of time their tested combat comrades.

At the bottom of the ravine, where there is a freezing stream, it's cold and damp, and in the stream of Sonya finds a frog that fell asleep before spring and eats it, warming the pieces in her mouth before swallowing. She breaks off a sharp bitch and pulls a bullet out of her leg that passed the tibia almost through and settled on the other side of her skin.

Sonja comes out of the ravine and goes on for so long that the forest begins to rip as if the charter were inventing new trees in front of Sonya's eyes. Once again, she feels wind breathing on her face and soon falls into the spacious fields that have been removed by the combine fields. Sonia, walking barefoot on a coldly fucked to winter earth, is thinking of her being alone in the universe, where the tenderness of real life is absent. She's thinking of extinct flowers whose butons can't open up to the sun of their beauty, and of flying birds who can't go back. The rain is over, the cloud is the moon from the tear, lighting up the field and the tree, all alone growing at the cliff of time, and the rusty tractor, loaded with wheels into the neutral strip between the sky and the ground.

Fyodor Petukhov, a wheel tractor, drove his agricultural car for 25 years. He loved the tractor as his mother, Evdokia Alexeevna, who died of mental disorder when Fyodor, drunk in a field, fell under a haymower and lost both legs. At Fyodora City Hospital, he was given crutches instead of legs, which he could walk on, but did not drive heavy machinery. Fyodor immediately began drinking the moonshine, preventing the body from falling down from execution, and drank very quickly to rabies, started beating his wife and children, and under New Year's Eve even punched Communist Gurin's chairman in the face when he tried to make sense of Fyodor's family life. Because of this animal behavior, Fyodor's wife left, and the others avoided the angry tractorist, who was always drunk and afraid of unbridled rebellion.

On one occasion, when Fyodor was poking at the window of the village in the summer evening and unbridled the sloppy song, his attention was suddenly drawn to the stars falling over the roofs of blackened in the coming dark. Fyodor slowed down his sledgehammer and sprained himself out of the light, splashing his mouth, and then suddenly the demonic power of the hero of the Great Patriotic War, Meresiev, came into his throat with a strong thrust. Fyodor rode on crutches in the cabbage field, wearing a muzzle and spitting from his loose mouth, as if he was trying to get rid of the damn thing. In the middle of the field, he made a particularly long jump and, without keeping his balance, fell to the ground, dropped the crutches and crawled, burying his hands and repelling the cults from the soil.

But the power of the dead pilot didn't leave Fyodor, and he finally got pissed off, settled in the open fields and forgot his crutches, and used a rolling-field method to move in space, reaching such a speed that neither the combine nor the tractor could follow him. Fyodor was eating with rainworms that he dug up from the ground, and he was pressing a rolling mass of chickens that no one had decided to take away, and he ate them raw, lying in the field under the head of a rusty tractor, which now became his home. True, once Grigory's petrotech tried to shoot a pissed-off berdan tractorist, but Fyodor's bullet didn't take it.

When the lame Sonya appears on the forest horizon that is rocking Fyodor's arena from the south, he has just climbed out of the tractor and is lying in the middle, rejoicing at the end of the long rain and the arrival of the air weather. The moon shines its hair mixed with the ground, and the wind hits the sky in the face. When Fyodor gets hot, he throws his molested hands like wings, and the darkness of the earth merges for him with the darkness of the sky, as always, before he leaves in his rusty tractor in combat. There's a clean, rain-washed, deadly silence in the fall, Fyodor flying alone, free of a heavy war machine.

Sonia stops over him, leaving an almost transparent shadow from the moon floating in the sky.

" Where are you going, Uncle? " she quietly asks so as not to make it very difficult for a man without a leg to float.

Fyodor's missing looking at her.

" I'm resting in front of a training air fight, " he says.

" I was told the woods around here are growing stone, " says Sonia modestly, bent over to touch the wounded tibia.

" The forest is not here, but far away, but nobody believes in it, and I saw it from the plane, " says Fyodor.

" I believe, " Sonia says. " Can you show me the way?

"You don't get there, girl," Fyodor sighs, somehow moved by Sonia's understanding to a condition close to the human being.

- Where's your plane?

- Fyodor swings his hand towards the tractor.

" How can there be no fuel? " Sonia asks, looking at the rust - covered machine with its wheels in the ground like coastal water with no confidence.

- I can't get there, I can't get through the fence.

Not only does he not find any flight capability in the tractor, but he also has doubts about his mobility, Sonja sighs.

- You, girl, don't be sad, the car's perfectly fine, - Fyodor climbs up on the fists of straight hands and crawls up to the wheel of the tractor, where the nails of the stars, indicating probably the number of broken enemy tractors, are crooked. - Go get the fuel and we'll fly right away.

- Okay, I'm tired of Sonia agreeing.

You go straight to the window, you get out of Volodya, you walk right past her, you go straight to the fence, you go to the right gate, you knock, you'll get Cyrilovna off, you tell her the museum's here to see it. Grab a bucket over there and over here, okay?

- Got it.

Sonia's snooping towards the village, and in the moonlight, you can see the little rugged huts of the village edge hiding behind the pathetic apple around their old nakedness. In the distance, in the middle of the fields, there's one yellow lamp, a large building, where there's a lot of machinery standing up until spring, and the smell of Sonya's approaching, and the village dogs raise the bark.

The Kolkhose Museum is more like a barn, from which a candlestick for the celebration of red banners sticks in its three-palm hand. The stunt overfell him, the yard was ground with a dry brown, and the glass in the dark window was broken in the middle by a stone, which caused the window to be boarded from the inside. Sonia knocks on a tablet with the inscription "Michovin Museum of Colkhoz," which is smashed on the fence, no one responds to the knock, and Sonya kicks the gate with force. The dog in the adjacent yard is drenched by the bark, the greasy chain, and Kirillovna comes from the museum with a fishing lantern. She shines in Sonya's squeezing face, unable to wake up from a long, dying dream. Her face, shrivelled like an old apple, is freaking out about the arrival of an unknown creature because the old woman fears that she will die.

" I, Grandma, came from town to see the museum, " says Sonya, blinding her eyes.

" At night? " asks Cyrilovna himself. " Come in the morning. The museum is now closed.

" I have to go to school in the morning, " Sonia lies.

Right after believing Sona as the reality of her life beyond, Cyrilovna unlocks the gate and the knob pulls the notebook out of the tub to give the girl a ticket.

" Only I don't have any money, " Sonia sighs sad.

" No need for money, granddaughter, " says Cyrilovna, stretching out Sonia with a shaky, dried-up leaf from a notebook with something scratched with a shrivelled pencil. - It's been a long time since anyone's come to see the museum.

Inside the museum, the main part of it is the iron oven and the Cyrilovna bed, and there is a board of velvet that hangs on the wall in front of the window, covered with a hole in algae, with photos of the Chairman of the Colkhoz and other Communists, mostly long dead. There's a portrait of an old man hanging on the back wall in his professor's glasses and beard, and he's supposed to act like a great villager named Michinin, named Kolkhoz. There's a table under the portrait with a two-litre jar of cucumbers on the bottom of which there's dead flies and brown dirt.

Cyrilovna lights a naked light bulb growing on the wire from the wall and tells Sonia the legendary history of colkhoz, which dates back to the mythical years of collectiveization and the fight against unclean fist power. Sonya won't listen to her by looking down at the old man's portrait over the table and rubbing her dirty jacket's shoelace with her hands.

- What's that in your bank? - Suddenly she's asking Kirillovna out of the blue.

Cyrilovna's confused is dumb looking at the dusted glass of the jar, which is still showing traces of a loose sticker.

" These are the seeds of pomegranate eucalyptus that the scientist Michureen gave us, " she finally remembers.

" Why are you going to put them in jail? " Sonia is interested in leaning toward the bank.

The seeds will rot in our dead land, and the memory of the great gardener will be destroyed, so they lie here for years, communism waiting for the whole earth to come back to life.

" You can see, " Sonia says, "blows up the jar and drowns the contents on the table.

You can't! " Cyrilovna's an old-fashioned streak. " You're doing something!

Sonia can see a bunch of dust and dead flies with some big black seeds before the old lady pushes her away from the table, and the sleepy one turns around and beats Cyrilovna's head with a can. The jar crumbles and collapses in Sonny hands, and Kirillovna crumbles to the floor only after putting his hand on the forehead.

- You want to kill me, you little bastard, she says it's snoring.

Sonia, kneeling on Kirillovna's chest, pulls a pillow off her bed and holds her hand against the old woman's face. Cyril's mooing and twitching, suffocating and stabbing with wrinkled fists on Sona, who pulls the razor out of her pocket with a free hand and pushes the pillow up a little bit, slits the old woman's sloppy throat. The bony old body that has been sucked into life loses blood for a long time, shivering under Sonia in the anticipation of death, but then it puffs and subsides. When she's done with the money, Sonya picks out a bunch of mychurin seeds on the table and hides them in her jacket pocket, and then she finds the bucket in the yard that Fyodor was talking about. It turns out to be a full-blown rainwater.

When Sonya brings a footless bucket, he's already sitting in his car with a lick moving long levers. He pours the brought liquid into the engine, the tractor coughs up, bounces off the spot, and starts cockroaching loudly. Sonia can get up to the cockpit before Fyodor, with a fierce fight swinging in the saddle, moves the car from its nest. As the tractor moves, it goes to the rural road, throwing its wheels around the raw ground. The legless Fyodor, who curbed his shivering rusty hump, ruled with confidence to the north, screaming at his own mates and occasionally a violent and rabid war.

By the pasmour of dawn, Sonja climbs into the cut-off knees of the tractor, arms around his neck, and pulls his head to his chest, and falls asleep tired of the night that passed. And Fyodor, alone, continues to take her where he's never been.

Smallpox and groaning on the grass, the pale green foam crawling out of her mouth, and the pupils are completely invisible between centuries.

" It's like a three-sucker, " says the bear politely, stubbing his own hat.

- Look, if you die, Oppa, you're worried about Rat, wandering around a lying friend and squeaking around his shoulders.

" Power is in the shacks, " says the Bear, biting off the thread.

Natasha lies on the elbow, next to the barrel, and watches the herb torn with its fingers by the shamaning guerrilla, the left man smokes himself and cleans his weapon while staring at the river. The invisible Opper carries a guard watch in the bushes, and the rain stopped, and the grey shadow clouds make the pale moon look mysteriously.

I see! "A puncture that suddenly sees smallpox poking into the sky and spitting foam. " A rat falls down on it and holds it firmly on its shoulders while a rabid punk stabs his friend's strong body. I see a girl heading north, heading north, the earth's skin is tearing up, the devil is driving her, the devil is dragging her, the inexorable power of fascism! Birds fight, rip, rip the meat bloody! The meat is juicy, and the blood is spattering! " The ass's screams fall into the delusional abyss. " The horns are blue, the meat is bloody! " She groans many times under the rat. - The horns are blue, the meat is bloody!

The one who got on the Rat's side, Leshan, rolls the head of the Axe with an iced river water out of the pot, and the bear comes up with a cocktail over his head. Through narrow wrinkled slits in his face, his eyes do not look kindly to the north, as if they were considering how to end the world.

In the unclear light of the early November morning, a car with the inscription "Bread............................................................................................................ His unbridled face is distorted in the glass of the box, becoming like a pork moat, smashing through the gate with an iron and screaming at the booth, rolling out watery eyes. In return, he sounds like an automatic line, and the driver is pulled over by the bullets that hit him, and he drops his back on his asphalt, ringing a rack. In the blink, there is a crooked figure of Leshoe, who, by holding his arms and smokes himself, first tastes the driver &apos; s face with his boot and then picks up the truck. The short whistle means that the car is okay. The left lifts the gate, crossing the body of the fascist regulator lying in the booth and climbing up to the cab, crossing the bridge, the truck cries, and in the river it feels increasing anger.

Sonia wakes up when it's light, and it's covered with thick, smokey clouds, blue slits in which the sun shines at the edges of the autumn sun. The thunder of a moving tractor bursts the silence of the wintering fields, and five birds with a rough wedge swim on a small wave of wind to the east, believing that there is still a lot of heat and light where the sun comes from. Lying cheeks on Fyodor's strong chest, Sonja groaning and sleepy staring at the closing fields.

Partyans are chasing a tractor around noon when the road passes through the forest. The truck is overtaking and stopping 50 metres in front of the road, turns around slowly towards the tractor. In the back of the body, the guerrillas jump into non-road dirt and go infantry after the car.

- Surrender, you bastard!

- Surrender, you bastard!

Fyodor slows down, doesn't turn off the engine, the Sonja gets off his knees, doesn't make any sudden moves to stop the shooting from starting, her body shivers a little bit with the fear of the heavy blows of bullets. When she surrenders, she raises her hands up.

" Taking them alive, " the bear boils, severely destroying the water - filled gauge with boots.

The convergence of vehicles is slowly continuing. Fyodor stares at the mud-splashed windshield of the truck and at the scary lupo-eyed face of the Soviet car, gilling its mouth. Natasha walks on the left side of the truck with lacquered fingernails cut, a thin patch of hair falls on her face and she blows it through her squeezed lips. She's got a bandage on her waist that pulls the wounded side, and she looks in Sonya's bright, semi-translucent eyes, calm and still, like stars. She's looking at Sonya's hair and her hands raised up, thin wrists coming out of the sleeves of her jacket. She looks at the girls' open palms, showing that she doesn't have any weapons, and she sees a glowing pale yellow light a circle in the air above the tips of her fingers. As the enchanted looks at Natasha on a bright sunny ring, a little blurry by the field wind until it breaks off from its seat and, silently slips into space, smashes the truck's window with a bell and covers the cab with flames.

With the wild war, the left one jumps out of the cockpit on the side of the road, and the clothes on it are on fire. Natasha's looking for Sonya's eyes to shoot her with a cut, but Sonya's gone, she only sees Fyodor's rabid face pointing the tractor right at her to round the driver's abandoned truck to the left. Natasha throws himself into the trees, shooting a tractor at the back, and the bear opens fire from the machine. Bullets smashed Fyodor's body, ripping blood out of his clothes with meat, but hard hands of a legless one are increasingly racing satanin's wailing car. The bear retreats away, continuing to put a bullet in Fyodor after a bullet, somewhere on the other side of the road, closing the engine's roar, starting to rip off the Rat's machine gun. The tractor's tyres are bursting, it's starting to boil in the mud, and somewhere on the other side, it hits a truck in a tree, finally breaking its burning cockpit. There's a fire wave passing through the tractor, sniffing through the fire in the middle of the bear's track, and the commander of the squad is in pain crying and running under the cover of the trees. Far ahead, Natasha's tractor sees Sonia running on the road, losing her invisibility from the rapid movement, and Natasha is aiming at her with a cut on her shoulder. Sony's figure swims in the hot air coming from a fire-ridden tractor, where he finds himself worthy of a great Viking burial by a legless Fyodor, and suddenly disappears into the air. Natasha screams out of angry rabies and has a hard time running after her, but the road ahead is completely empty, and she will soon stop crying, crying, and without aiming at the forest without living.

Black Moscow

He put his hand on me.

And he said unto me, Fear not.

I am the First and the Last and the Living;

And he was dead, and behold, he lived forever and ever, amen.

And I have the keys of hell and death.

Opening 1.17–1.18

On the way, by tearing off his jacket and throwing it on the road, Sonya runs and runs away from the battlefield without seeing that neither the guerrillas nor the burning cars are behind him. It only stops when light snowflakes come out of the air, sticking to the face and cold drops left on the skin. With her wrist around her eyes, she looks back and sees only a field under a snowy sky, and there's so quiet in the field that you can hear snowflakes shrieking about each other. Sonia walks along a white road, leaving little barefoot tracks until a wide, dark strip of stone trees appears in front.

The stone forest is filled with graveyard snow rest. Sonia is not reflected in the mirror cortex of black trunks raised in the mist of the winter sky, nor in the perlamutromous labyrinth of anthracyte branches, as if it did not exist in reality. Here the snow falls continuously and slowly, undisturbed by any wind, and no bird interrupts the stability of the trees once gripped by the indestructible eternity of its new material.

Sonia goes deeper and deeper into the woods, feeling the burning breath of the cold reigning in him, but the snow no longer stings her bare feet, only with a gentle crunch wraps them in his soft palms. Through the blazing snowflakes, Sonya begins to distinguish between frozen figures of dead pioneers who raise their hands for a salutation and stare straight blue faces into the eternal rest of winter. Allied ties burn on their necks, snowflakes melt on silk tissue, unable to extinguish the space fire of childhood memory. Sonia passes by them, staring into calm young faces with as clear eyes as hers. She finds among them Tanya, stylishly straightened by a mirror trunk with a raised hand, and this new hand, which does not know rat blood and poisonous night rains, seems to be cleaner than anything carefully washed by the death of Tanina's body.

" Do you recognize me, Tanya?" whispered to Sonya, stopping across from Tanya. Tanya doesn't talk. Her eyes look through Sonya in the vertical stream of snow. By turning around, Sonja sees Alexey standing opposite Tanya, and his face is no longer dark, but full of a pure and bright vision of time, which is destined to come many years later.

Tanya, it's me, Sonya. Sonia puts her hands on the tangles of her cheeks and breathes into her face. But even her hot breath can't melt the perpetuity of Tanya's enchanted dream.

Sonia walks through the stone forest, sometimes approaching an Indian boy or an innocent girl and in vain trying to make them remember their lives. She irons the pioneers with her hands, kisses their blue with their golden lips on her face, holds her burning heart to them. However, the scary eternal frost, which has no temperature, is stronger than Sonina's love, and pioneers continue to give their salutations, and the snow continues to fall like petals of ice cherries in the sky, and mirror trees, as if covered with negative film, reflect its continuous downward movement.

The forest cuts and Sonya goes to an endless marble cosmodrome, the snow isn't lying on it, but Sonya's feet still piercing frost needles when she walks barefoot on a polished black stone. In the middle of the stone space there is a huge black pyramid, and twelve beautiful comsomoles with braided ears, in black dresses up to their knees, are held in the hands of torches burning with the blue flame of the communist spring.

Sonia slowly approaches the pyramid, and snowflakes melt on its unflashing eyes, and it approaches a ladder that rises on the wall of the pyramid to the top. The knobs come down to her, unheard of in thin, bare feet on wide marble steps.

" Hello, brave girl, " whispers one of them with brown hair. " At last you came, a girl with a terrible mascot in her chest, so that the sun of hope would rise over the eternal winter, " the knob will bow to Sona and kiss her in the temple.

" Who are you? " asked Sonya.

" We are the archangels of the revolution, " the whispers of the girl respond in one voice. - We are the blisters of the Black Pyramid, the keepers of the eternal fire of Communism, we commoles, who have died young and sinless, gather human blood so that the fire of communism does not extinguish in the hearts of future generations. Our feet walking down the steps of the holy stone do not know the uncomfortable shoes, the ears that hear all the sounds of the world — the golden earrings, the fingernails that touch the sacrificed pial — the chemical lacquer, and the mouths that carry the word of communism are false lipstick. Our bosoms cannot be broken because they are bound by the chief's covenant, our dresses cannot be removed because they are bound by the chief's covenant, our thoughts are always clean, because they forever hold the chief's thought...

- Lenin, "Sonia speaks quietly, closing her eyes. " He's right here.

Lenin's sleeping, whispering a chestnut ball called Vera, in his black mausoleum, in the Black Square of the Black Kremlin.

" Sleeping? " Asks Sonya again.

" Eternal cold binds the chief, the power of a terrible curse guards his mortal sleep, " whispers the second girl who has russian hair and wife's name. No one, no one can get into the Black Mavsoley because there's no entrance, only you can do it, you brave girl with a scary mascot in her chest. But to do that, you need to enter the Black Kremlin, which guards the dead communists, they can kill you forever, they can make you disappear forever. They're gonna get in here soon, because the fire of communism is weakening, and he's missing pure human blood.

" Yes, human blood has become filthy, " sighs a black-haired, skinny lump with the faces of Sonia's acquaintance. " It's more and more like pig blood.

" Have I seen you somewhere? " Sonia asks. " I think your face is familiar.

" Of course you've seen me, " the girl smiles with tender sadness. " Look, "she pulls her hand off the collar of the dress, showing a purple scar on the thin neck.

So you live here, so they couldn't hang you.

I was alive before the revolution, and human death has no control over me, but soon we're all gonna die.

- I'm gonna wake Lenin up.

" I'm sorry for you, brave girl, " says Zoe. " But you don't have the strength to defeat the dead communists.

" She has a terrible mascot in her chest, " interrupts Vera. " Maybe he'll help her.

" And you? " Sonia asks. " Will you help me?

" We can't leave the Black Pyramid, " answers the composter with a broken lip, named Anya. " It's the chief's covenant, and we can't break it. We have to defend the flames of communism until the last. Perhaps our faith wasn't strong enough, we can't live far from the holy flame.

" But we can do something for you, " Zoe adds quietly. " We'll give you some holy fire, just a little because he's already weak.

Zoe turns around and comes up to the wall of the Black Pyramid, merges with her reflection and disappears, soon comes back, holding a spark of blinding light in her hand.

- That's enough to destroy the cold of death for one person outside, she whispers by moving the fire into Sony's extended hand. Now, goodbye, you need to hurry before the spark in your hand goes out.

Space frost refills Sonya as she moves away from the Black Pyramid, so it's even getting hard for her to breathe. She carries the spark of holy fire into the stone forest with her hands tied together, fearing that the snow might extinguish it along the way. The fire keeps warming its palms, and Sonia runs, holding his hands to his chest and sliding down the ice-cold black marble. She flies up to the first pioneer standing her back, stumbles and almost falls into the soup, and holds the spark of the flame she has given to her back with her palms.

For a while, the pioneer remains still, and Sonja holds his breath and looks at his thin hand raised in the salute, and finally his hand slowly falls down and shaves the ion off his face.

" Hey," Sonia says, " her voice sounds weird in the snowing silence of the stone forest.

The boy turns to Sona, has a thin face and dark curly hair, and a pioneer drum hangs on his chest.

" I'm the one who woke you up, " she says. " Lenin's case is in danger.

The pioner lifts his eyes up to the sky like he's remembering something, and Sonya's scared if he's forgetting the cold dream who Lenin is, but the boy's hands suddenly grab the drumsticks and the dry blow of the pioneer alarm sounds in the stone forest. The drummer stabs desperately, distorting his thin face, and Sonya sees dead pioneers awake from sleep throughout the forest, ready to perform their sacred duty.

- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

" It's just a jacket, " says Lefty, cold, looking in the field binoculars.

The smallpox swears by the mat and spits into the unusually clear snow of the abandoned road lying on the side of the road, the left-hand turns the binoculars perpendicular to the road and sees in it the endless black walls of Moscow.

- Moscow, he's blissfully snoring.

The bear looks long at the binoculars selected from Left and the snot sniffs of falling snow, following its silent sign, the guerrillas roll off the road and the snowfield goes to Black Moscow. Their ragged faces are wrinkled by a breeze of frost, and it's hard to hear Rat singing a dark guerrilla song that speaks of the hopeless boredom of the living dead abandoned in the enemy's back.

The walls of Moscow grow silently from the snow desert, as if a huge armoured ship crawling into the guerrillas. The metal of the machine in the bones freezes Natasha's hands, the ice nails get deeper into the eyes, with pain excruciating tears, dripping off her white cheeks, and the drowning lips slip into a still-like smile. With this smile, Natasha's doll is walking in a bourgeois field, and in front of her eyes, lazyly crawling on the deserted winter shore, a cold, bloody sea.

In the middle of the field, there's a man in a military tire and a shank with a half-strengthed ace star.

- Hey, kid! - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

The soldier turns around, his face is covered with indelible wrinkles of past battles, and he has a rifle in his hand.

" I'm a soldier, " he just answers. " I don't even have a last name.

- Drop the rifle or I'll shoot you, yell at the rat with a machine gun in front of him.

" Shoot, you bastard, I'm not taking a bullet," says the soldiers calmly.

For the test, Bear shoots a soldier alone, and the bullet punches a gymnast on a fighter's chest without even giving blood.

" Ours, " the bear cries, staring at a hole in the gymnasium behind which the void is dark. " Tell us where the enemy is, we will be until the last.

" This is the final frontier, " the soldier answers. " Moscow is behind us.

Without trying to dig the earth's cold, the guerrillas lie in the field, preparing for battle, and the unknown soldier stands over them like a banner. Natasha sits behind a suffocating ground, laying a blood-sprayed bullet on the snow, closing her eyes so that they can get less pain from the frost. There's a drum fight going on far away.

- They're coming, they're snoring. - They're coming, you bastards.

In a snowy desert, the thin chains of dead pioneers are moving, the kecan of a barefoot step, and the child's blood burns through the blazing of the white ties on their necks. They're getting closer and the drum's song is moving up, talking about the infinite and eternal joy of dying for Lenin's cause. This song flies over beautiful white children's faces, glowing with the happiness of justified death, and guerrillas chain in their graves like frogs crawling out of January's ice. The children's golden lips move in a transparent pioneer oath whose power grows, even the snowflake's ashes falling from the sky become gold.

- Go ahead, cry out insanely to the Unknown Soldier and go up against the enemy by lifting the bayonets.

But the guerrillas cannot stand behind him; they already see the clear eyes of the incoming pioneers and read their final death in them.

" The Unknown Soldier screams without speeding up his step. " — Yay!

The fire leaves his boots in the snowfields, crashing into the pioneer ranks and planting a burning death, and some pioneers with thin screams fall into the snow, turning into blue ashes. The hands of the pioneers wave their greeting and the blue lightning connects the field to the invisible sky. The unknown soldier falls in half the electricity and his body melts out of the snow that rained in the spread of lightning streams. The pioners wave their hands again, and the second lightning strikes the soldier, killing thousands of prisoners in his life. Several times a soldier rises and falls again, until the last blow ignites his empty body, which remains forever in a field covered with eternal fire.

The partyers are silently looking at the massacre, reshuffling themselves to fill the holes of fire in their ranks, the dead pioneers pass by the Soldier. Natasha can already tell their faces, she recognizes Tanya, who once threw a crowbar at her head, and her finger is whipping a gashet. The gunshot closes the drum for a moment, and when the guerrillas wake up from the damn cordon, they start firing bullets, and a few pioneers fall into the snow. Thin hands give up again, and lightning blows out the frozen ground. Recharged by shivering hands, Natasha sees the body of the Left One burning face in the snow, and the blood slowly soaking the snow spreads around him with a dark spot. The head of the Left One is opened like a half-eaten melon, with grenades thrown by Ospoy in front of it, two pioneers, a boy and a girl, take off into the blizzard and fall their heads into the ground, breaking their necks. Not far from the vortex, there's another boy who's been ripped out of his body below his abdomen, and there's blood coming out of him and his guts crawling. Natasha is aiming at Tanya's face, but with the rabid noise in her eyes, she gets dark, and she drops her mouth on the barrel of the cutting, throwing her hair into the bloody snow.

With the same blow, Ospa sneaks back in his hand with the wrist machine, and she beats her back to the hard ground, and the Ospa's clothes are full of blood. Time is slow for her, snow is hanging in the air, unable to fall on her face. When she turns her head around, she looks at her torn arm, painting the snow, and then, at the pieces of a large commander's body, scattered within a few metres of a blood circle, and then, at the disfigured corpse of a one-eyed rat with a torn throat, frozen by a laced with its machine gun, and on Natasha's body, squeezing in his sleep, and on the Opaj, tiredly crawling forward, facing the enemy. She watches him pull the ring out of a grenade, and she takes up the ground's stone comets, and the face burns with an explosive wave, drops of fresh blood drops on her cheeks. She sees the boy's face leaning over her and believes that she sees an angel after all these years remembering the prayers of her prewar mother and the icon at the cockroach oven. The golden lips touch her compressed mouth, and the shock of the current forever punctures her throat.

Natasha opens her eyes, the snow moves endlessly, like a bunch of white moths in a hurry to leave their offspring in the short time of their lives. Sonia sits on her knees next to her. They're at the bottom of the silence. Natasha feels the end is near. The silent look of death has stopped on it. She's beginning to hear the only sound: the flow of blood in the depths of the sky.

" How can that be? " Sonia asks quietly. " There is no life anywhere else.

" You don't know about life, " Sonia answers. " Drink, "she puts her wrist on Natasha's mouth. " Take your blood back.

- I don't want to," Natasha whispers.

- Drink, "Sonia says nicely. " I love you.

Natasha bites the girl's wrist carefully.

" Drink, " Sonia patiently repeats, holding his hand closer to Natasha's mouth.

Natasha makes two sucking throats, and Sonya takes her hand.

" I can hear the sun song, " says Natasha, and a pale smile strikes her face.

" That's good, " Sonia answers, closing the wound with a piece of snow.

" How can I be alive? " Natasha doesn't believe.

" It'll pass, " Sonia says. " You feel your blood is turning red again, like flowering roses.

Natasha spreads her hands aside, putting them in cold snow, a vast space no longer seems alien to her if there is a Sonya who loves her. Natasha breathes space into himself, filled with the cold of eternal love.

" I have to go, " Sonia says.

" I'm with you, " says Natasha.

" No, you're going to go there," Sonia shows her hand to the side of where the guerrillas came from. "The seeds of evil have long since grown up. Find them and help me. If I'm alive, she adds sadly.

" If you're alive? " Natasha repeats with fear.

" Without Lenin, we will all die, " says Sonya.

Sonia rises up and walks toward Black Moscow, kicks the pioneer drum far away, walking in snowfields, and Natasha looks back and sees the chains of dead pioneers approaching the walls of the city. ‘ Rise fire, blue nights!'the incoming pioneers sing. The black gate on which the skulls have been etched is dissolved, and black checkers come out silently. They don't have human faces like soft matter dolls, they raise rifles and shoot with a dry cod without aiming, and every silver bullet hits the heart. The pioners fall out of their white shirts, their blood spreads out in the snow, their bodies begin to burn, turning into short-lived blond bonfires. In the blue lights of lightning, all the new Chequetist rows come out of the gate failure. The shivering earth spreads before it without end and edge, as if the damned Galileo had deceived mankind.

She runs over the cold boogers and screams fear because she doesn't know what's waiting for her in the deserted fields. There's a road that's got Sonina's jacket on, right next to it in the snow there's two-metre green stalks with leaves and big buds. The exhausted Natasha crawls to the plants, squeezing his teeth to the pain, growing in front of her, barely visible but inexorably expanding into the cold space of the kingdom of death.

" Bloody sunflowers, " says Natasha, "where the name in her head came from. "Damn sunflowers, lovely flowers of evil.

Her hands are reaching for the closed butons, which have come up through the cold infertility of impermeable mercure from magical Mychurin seeds. She already understands their new property, created not by nature, but by scientific sorcery, and her face brightens the tender joy of knowledge.

" Look! " Natasha screams, raising her face to the empty sky. " Look what I have for you! " Her hands are torn apart by the dense walls of the boutons, the yellowing petals in the light.

One by one, Natasha opens the sunflowers, staring into the black ones, like the seeds of Hellfire, and it starts raining. Far, near the walls of Black Moscow, Sonya, he laughs and extends his hands to the water flowing from the sky, and over the battlefield a huge rainbow shines. There's a burning light coming out of the blizzards of snow clouds, and it's coming out of the damn sunflower sunflowers.

The dead checkers and the war meet the arrival of artificial spring, trying to hide in the failure of the black walls, they light up before they fall, and the melting snow is covered with piles of burning ashes. And they fall down, and they ride in the earth, seeking to extinguish the fire that burns them from within. And somewhere in the dark fields, a young girl with a handsome peasant face luxuriously turns up the petals of terrible flowers, filled with love for insensitive plant life, whispering to them words in a language they can't understand, as the sun says.

After removing the drum from the dead silver bullet of the pioneer, Tanya beats the dawn of the morning. All the streets are burning by the dying warriors of death, and Sonya is horrified by their huge numbers, and their burning is so hot that the melted waters are already flowing under the feet of the pioneers, gathering in streams. On the front of the desert prospectus, embroidered by the islands of fire, there is a black old car, covered in flames in the front, in the back seat of which a thin officer in a leather coat threw his head back. From the cracks in the round glasses of the small glasses, there's blood dripping. The face of an officer with dark earthy colors. Sonia approaches the car and takes off two fingers from the dead glasses and smashes them into asphalt. The corpse in the car is slowly covered with flames because Beria's glasses no longer help him to see the future and to avoid a close look at death.

The sun glitters in the puddles with melted water, led by a drum, the pioneers walk through the streets of Black Moscow, past uninhabited houses whose windows have been broken and the walls have been smashed and ripped from time to time. The huge city around them is dead, no one lives in it, and houses are destroyed by themselves, depressed by the aimlessness of their existence.

Sonya's eyes see a black stripe at the end of a long street, and its sensitive nostrils catch a streak of terrible gloom running towards a group of little winners. She realizes that there's a new enemy in front of her, even scarier and more dangerous than the previous one.

Wait for me, says Natasha's voice in her temples, now it's my turn to kill them, and Sonia is obediently stopping in the middle of the street to wait.

When Natasha ironed the petals of the last sunflower, she lay in the dark snow and looked at the blue sky, calling for the birds to leave for ever to the south. She wanted the second sun to come out as bright as the first, because the sun is lonely alone in infinite blue space, it doesn't have Sonya, there's no little bright-eyed sister who could love him. And let the two suns burn all the living, I thought Natasha, it doesn't matter, let the boiling heat fall on the ground, let it all die, because nature is not life at all.

And the earth, which was frozen by the river, was crumbled by it, and a part of it was drowned by a melting field, and the fresh spring air burst into the released water, and the river devil came out of the water, leading to the heights of the black dead horse, and his head was punctured by a bullet, but the wound healed with time.

" You melted the ice of eternal winter, beautiful girl, " said the river devil with a boiling voice. " You brought the fish back to the world of the world, you freed me from the curse of death. Take my horse and my sword, because I feel like you love killing.

And Natasha stood up in the mud, and took a rusty sword from his green hand.

" At last, my sword will bleed out again, " he whispered. " Now I must not keep it at the bottom of the river. Kill and kill.

Natasha put the boot in the driveway and climbed up on the back of a horse that snooped evilly beneath it and went forward. It was as if the sword was attached to her palm, and Natasha felt a tremendous force of death rising up in her chest, looking back at the place where the river devil stood, but he was gone. And then she remembered where she saw that sneaky mustache face, and the horse carried it in the thawing fields, smelling the wind in the eternal spring, hit her in the eye. Love and hatred merged into one great painful feeling, and the fire of inhuman freedom burned in the blood. No one could stop her because she had a second scary talisman in her hand, the sword of the civil war hero of the red horse of Chapaev.

When dead crewmen run into the bayonets, Sonya throws fire at them, and his blows are torn by two mighty brown bodies into stinking pieces. Sonia's gonna run and throw fire again, but there's too many crewmen and she can't stop their black wave. Once again, a drum is struck, and blue lightning is struck from the cloudless sky, as if the whole of the sky was made up of a flat electrical capacitor, hoarding lethal energy in its palm. Sonia runs back, and the crewmen crash into the pioneer ranks, steaming the bayonets of the children's bodies and breaking their head butts. By killing the crewmen, the beasts cry, and their boots are trampled by the corpses of the pioneers who fell on the asphalt, squeezing and piling them with dirt. Their chief, the giant sailor, is the Iron, who slits into the drummer's face like a fork, a long bayonet, punching Tanya's skull and ripping her throat with a blow. The girl falls on her back, and the sticks are slapped several times into the asphalt before her hands are locked in the stillness, moving on, the sailor strikes Tane on the abdomen, breaking the terrible weight of the ribs. One of the pioneers throws the Iron in the back and sticks his hands in the back of his head. The sailor's face captures a convulsive convulsive current from the boy's hands, but he still beats his butt over his shoulder, and Alexei falls back with his skull smashed, squeezing his hands. When the sailor turns around, he sticks a bayonet into his stomach like a shovel, leaning on his bent leg and lifting Alexei's twitching body into the air to throw it off to the edge of the street. And then the groaning horse passes by it, and the Chapaeva sword with the whistle blows off the big head of the sailor with the braid eyes on the swollen face, and the gigantic body, like the grooved body, falls on the road, hitting it with a fountain of stinking blood.

Natasha chops the hood, slits the other sailor's hand, chops off the third hand first, then the head and throws the horse forward to break the chest of the fourth man with hoofs, holding his hand behind the injured current of the neck. One of the crewmen hits the horse with a bayonet in the side, throwing coal blood, the horseman turns around and chops his head like a watermelon to the clavicles, splashing the face of a blonde pioneer standing next to him with a stinking brain. The saber with the whistle is swirling, and the crewmen who have already lost their chief are turning back. Natasha slices from the top, sticking to the lines, putting the weight of her body into the back, and from the side, putting the sword behind her back, and turning the hull sharply toward the enemy. She screams like a bird, dissecting the bones and muscles of the mighty men's bodies, to release the convulsive streams of dark blood.

A group of crewmen gather in front of her in a short line, pointing the bayonets forward, but Sonia's abandoned fire hits in the middle, smashing him in the middle, and the crisp blows of the sword finally break the enemy's resistance. The sailors run, and Natasha runs after them, killing every victim with one exact and strong blow of the sword, she rides the streets of a dead city, screaming wildly, and the echo of empty windows picks up her scream. She kills until there's no one to kill, and only then does the predator snatch back to the scene of the battle, and Sonia sits on the ground by Tanya's dead body, drowning her hands into the dark waters.

" Go back, " says Sonya to several surviving pioneers.

The pioners are silently and sadly looking at the bodies of fallen comrades, and there are no tears in their eyes.

" You won, " Sonia says. " Your faith was stronger. No one else stands in my way.

She rises up and walks towards Natasha, the velvet velvet rays of sunshine, and the ankles of Sonya are filled with clean, melted water. She welcomes Natasha's return by screaming, and her friend answers by putting her long eyelashes in the warm spring light.

On a shiny street are the black corpses of Natasha's chopped-up crewmen, from which the water washes out the dug blood. Sonia is passing through a slow-twisting sailor's cap with short ribbons, and around Natasha horse's hooves, the flow forms convulsions and vortexes. Looking back, Sonia sees the retreating pioneers and the reflections on the water of the blindly destroyed homes. Sonia is sad to remember Tanya and Alexei, continuing on the road, and he says good-bye to them in silence, interrupted by the throbbing of the flow and the mold of his own steps. She takes her hand and leads Natasha to the Black Kremlin, and the wind blows out their hair.

Between the houses, you can see the Kremlin towers lined with black burning stars, burning above the walls, at an elusive height, where the wind brings the white clouds. Sonia stops, struck by the magnificent sight of the magical rest that lurks in the lasurne spacious over the capital of death, and the earth blows under her feet. Sonia's tiny skin on his bare feet unmistakably determines that the impact spreads to the right and turns his face in there, slightly pulling his head back to look out because of Natasha's overlapping view. She sees a pilgrim figure sticking her head into the sky, a stone Lenin.

He screams awfully, raising a ferocious granite face to the nearest sky, and from the roaring of it the walls of the buildings fall down. He's taking another step, breaking a five-story house in the way, so the dust goes up to his belt, Natasha pulls Sonya on a horse.

Sonia screams, trying to scream a new rabid rug, and Natasha lets the horse go with a gallop, heading straight to the Kremlin gate. The stone giant comes at them with huge steps, indiscriminately crumbling the knees of the house, pulling a concrete lamppost out of the ground and throwing it into horsemen like a bat. When the pole rotates several times in the air, it flies across the Kremlin wall and breaks into huge groceries.

Following him to the Black Square, Natasha flies out, and hooves are humming on marble stoves to Mavsoleus. In the black columns, she slows down the horse and sits down Sonya, who runs on her own and slams into a monolithic stone wall that absorbs her like eternal darkness. Sonia ends up in a small, dusty electric light bulb room, and in the middle of the room there's a coffin with a glass lid, and Lenin's in the coffin.

His eyes are closed, his chest doesn't breathe, his face is covered with newspaper yellow, he's wearing a black suit and a white shirt, and his hands are folded on his chest.

Lenin is dead, speaking in Sonya's head of the thunder of a stone monster.

You're lying, suffocating from running, Sonia answers, and punches the coffin's lid, the shrapnel falls on the floor, and the cut in Sonina's hand is bleeding. With a terrible bang, the Kremlin walls smashed through the granite leg by a monster.

" Wake up, Lenin, " Sonia asks.

You'll never see the sun again. You'll never see the sun again. You'll die forever.

You're lying, you bastard, you're crying, you're lying.

But she realizes he's not lying, a giant Lenin of black granite really is alive, decades of human honor have given life to a naked man. And this is a small human body lying in a coffin in front of Sonya, just a dried corpse of a long-dead old man.

Lenin's long dead, why did you break the coffin, why did you break the peace, now you're gonna die, the rug becomes insufferable to human hearing, the Sonya holds her hands to the ears.

Come out, or I'll smash Mavzoley.

Sonia wipes her tears, she doesn't want her golem to see her cry. Before entering the square, she leans toward Lenin's breathless face and kisses him goodbye into the smelling hospital chemist forehead, and then Lenin opens his eyes.

" Hello, girl, " he says it's funny as if Sonya didn't wake him up, but she just met him in the hallway in front of his office.

Lenin comes up from the coffin and pulls off his jacket from dust and glass fragments.

Lenin sneaks out his jacket, grabs his hands and laughs loudly.

The wall of Mavsolei is struck by a terrible stone blow, and it breaks, and the shards of the slabs fall from a rift on the floor of the room. Through the black dust, you can see a huge scalded face of a monster that's rudely reminiscent of the face standing in front of Sonia's human face. The golly leans forward, sneaking granite fingers, and, along with a hell of a volcanic ripple, the fire is exploding out of his mouth.

- This titanium in the cap, is it me? It's a blazing thing, and Lenin's firmly waved his hand, and a terrible firestorm hits the Kremlin, covers the stone body of the golem, and eats it, sucks out the monster's black dust winds like it's made of ordinary coal sand. In the belt, the giant has been disproportionately deformed, and a blurted piece has come out of his chest and opens up a fireless hole.

" Let's all go, it's inevitable, " says Lenin, looking at the burning skyscraper, the giant, and putting his hand on Sony's shoulder. And for you boys and girls, you're gonna sneak your houses out of these accumulated elements of gasvalin.
