The Dark of Your Eyes
The Cat's Heart

The fifth angel sounded his trumpet, 
and I saw a star 
that had fallen from the sky to the earth. 
The star was given the key to the shaft of the Abyss.

Revelation 9.1

Sonya sits on a bench in front of the parade, folding her child's hands on her knees and staring right in front of her in the dark of the bushes. Not that she sees something invisible to an ordinary person, not that she's dreaming of something big and cold like a coal iceberg, Sona is a fantasy, because she doesn't believe in the coming of the future.
